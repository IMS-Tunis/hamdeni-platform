We join them with a single space using first_name + \" \" + last_name. upper() makes all letters uppercase. print(…) shows the final text.\nPart b: The test word_to_replace in sentence checks for an exact substring (case sensitive and can match inside longer words). If found, replace(old, new) creates a new string with all occurrences changed to \"Python\" and prints it. Otherwise a clear message is printed.\nPart c: split(\"/\") divides the date into three parts at each slash. We read index 0 as day, 1 as month, and 2 as year. Converting year to int confirms it is numeric. This simple version assumes the user types the format dd/mm/yyyy correctly."
