Theory Notes – Syllabus 14.2 (Circuit switching, packet switching)

Section 14.2a – Circuit switching
1) Circuit switching sends all data along the same path to the destination and does not change the route within switches during the transmission.
2) Circuit switching provides in‑order delivery and guaranteed bandwidth suitable for constant‑rate multimedia, but the dedicated circuit remains occupied even when idle and security can be weaker because a single route can be intercepted.

Section 14.2b – Packet switching
3) Packet switching is suitable for large non‑live‑streamed data on data networks, for rerouting around failed lines, for increased security, for high‑volume transmission, and for conserving bandwidth; typical applications include email, text messages, documents, and VoIP.
4) Packet switching offers accuracy and completeness through detection and retransmission of missing packets, resilience through dynamic routing, efficient shared bandwidth, and improved security; however, it can introduce delays for error correction, requires complex delivery protocols, and is unsuitable for real‑time transmission.
5) Circuit switching uses a pre‑established dedicated path, keeps the message intact and in order, uses full bandwidth, operates at the physical layer, may end on error, and is simpler; packet switching splits data into packets that may take different routes and arrive out of order for reassembly, shares bandwidth, is implemented at the network layer, and supports retransmission.
6) On the internet, packet switching splits a large message into equal‑size packets with headers that include source and destination IP addresses and sequence numbers; packets are dispatched independently along possibly different routes, the destination reassembles them into the original message, and missing or corrupted packets are requested again.
7) In packet switching, a router reads the destination IP address from the packet header, consults its routing table and route status to choose the next hop, and forwards the packet along the selected route.
