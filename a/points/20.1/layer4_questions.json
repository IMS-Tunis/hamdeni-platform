    "answer": "• Imperative languages use variables\n• … which are changed using (assignment) statements\n• … they rely on a method of repetition / iteration.\n• The statements provide a sequence of commands for the computer to perform\n• … in the order written / given\n• … each line of code changes something in the program run."

    "question": "Identify the programming paradigm for each of the following program code examples.
