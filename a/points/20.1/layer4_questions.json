    "question": "Identify the programming paradigm for each of the following program code examples. Write your answers as pairs (Code Example → Programming Paradigm).\n\nExample 1:\nmale(john).\nfemale(ethel).\nparent(john, ethel).\n\nExample 2:\nFOR Counter = 1 TO 20\n    X = X * Counter\nNEXT Counter\n\nExample 3:\nStart: LDD Counter\n       INC ACC\n       STO Counter\n\nExample 4:\npublic class Vehicle\n{\n    private speed;\n    public Vehicle()\n    {\n        speed = 0;\n    }\n}",
