          "mark_scheme_answer": "Correct answer: C\n\nMark points:\n‚Ä¢ Flowcharts are a design tool used to plan the steps of a solution before coding.\n‚Ä¢ Analysis and testing are stages in the PDLC; coding is implementation, not a design method.",

          "explanation": "Modular testing: test small pieces as you build them. Benefit: quick to find and fix mistakes.\nFinal testing: test the whole program at the end. Benefit: checks everything works together correctly.",
