"question_number": 2,
"question": "Describe two characteristics of RAM and two characteristics of ROM.",
"mark_scheme": "Answer:\n(Describe: state the points of a topic / give characteristics and main features)\nRAM: volatile; stores data, files, and parts of programs or the operating system currently in use.\nROM: non-volatile; stores fixed start-up instructions such as the bootstrap and BIOS."

"question_number": 3,
"question": "Compare DRAM and SRAM by giving three differences.",
"mark_scheme": "Answer:\n(Compare: identify/comment on similarities and/or differences)\nDRAM stores bits in capacitors and must be refreshed; it is cheaper and offers higher capacity.\nSRAM uses flip-flops, needs no refresh, and is faster, so it is used for cache."

"mark_scheme": "Answer:\n(Explain: set out purposes or reasons / make the relationships between things evident / provide why and/or how and support with relevant evidence)\nDisk thrashing is the very high rate of storage access caused by frequent swapping between RAM and virtual memory, which greatly reduces processing speed. It can be reduced by installing more RAM and by using an SSD instead of an HDD for virtual memory."

"question": "Explain why SSDs reduce latency compared to HDDs.",
"mark_scheme": "Answer:\n(Explain: set out purposes or reasons / make the relationships between things evident / provide why and/or how and support with relevant evidence)\nSSDs have no moving parts, so data is retrieved at a consistent rate without rotational delay, removing latency inherent in spinning disks."

{
"point_id": "3.3d",
"question_number": 17,
"question": "Outline how paging supports virtual memory.",
"mark_scheme": "Answer:\n(Outline: set out main points)\nMemory management moves fixed-length blocks called pages between RAM and the HDD/SSD, enabling programs larger than physical memory to execute at the cost of slower access."
