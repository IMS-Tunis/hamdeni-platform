    <h2>3.3a: Primary storage: RAM and ROM</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a type of storage that is directly accessed by the CPU.">primary storage</span> is the part of a computer‚Äôs <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="the devices within the computer that are directly accessible by the CPU; there are two types of memory ‚Äì RAM and ROM; memory is different to hard disk drives, for example, which are known as storage devices">memory</span> that can be accessed directly by the CPU through a direct connection.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">It includes two main types: <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="primary memory that can be written to or read from">random access memory (RAM)</span> and <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="primary memory that cannot be written to (changed) and can only be read">read only memory (ROM)</span>.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">RAM is a <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="describes memory that loses its contents when the power is turned off">volatile</span> type of storage, which means that all data is lost when the power is turned off.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">It can be read from and written to, and both the user and the computer can change its contents.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">It stores data, files, and parts of programs or the operating system that are currently in use.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">The larger the size of RAM, the faster the computer can work because it needs to access slower <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a type of storage that is designed to store data permanently, until it is deleted by the user.">secondary storage</span> less often.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">RAM can be upgraded by adding more RAM components when the computer supports expansion.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">RAM allows any memory location to be accessed directly and quickly, which is why it is faster than secondary storage.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">Two main types of RAM exist: dynamic RAM (DRAM) and static RAM (SRAM).</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">DRAM stores each bit of data in a tiny capacitor, with a <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a device that acts as a switch or gate for electronic signals.">transistor</span> controlling reading and writing. It must be refreshed regularly to keep its data.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">SRAM uses flip flops to store each bit of data, does not need refreshing, and is faster than DRAM.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">DRAM is cheaper and has higher capacity, so it is used for main memory. SRAM is used for very fast memory areas such as the CPU cache.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">ROM is a non volatile type of storage, meaning it keeps its contents when power is turned off.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">Its contents are fixed and cannot normally be changed by the user or by applications.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">It is used to store start up instructions, such as the bootstrap and the BIOS, which the computer needs when it is first switched on.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">Key differences between RAM and ROM are:</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">RAM is temporary, volatile, and can be written to and read from.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">ROM is permanent, non volatile, and can only be read.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">RAM stores working data, while ROM stores fixed data needed for starting the system.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
      <li><div class="example-box">Remote controlled toy car: In such a device, ROM can store factory settings and basic control routines, while RAM can temporarily store instructions received from the remote control. This shows why devices need both fixed start up data and temporary working memory.</div></li>
      <li><span class="fun-tip">Think of RAM like your desk space ‚Äî the bigger it is, the more papers you can spread out without having to constantly go to the filing cabinet.</span></li>

    <h2>3.3b: Secondary storage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">Secondary storage refers to storage devices that are not directly accessed by the CPU.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">Data and instructions from secondary storage must first be transferred into primary storage before processing.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Secondary storage can be internal or external to the computer.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">Secondary storage is non volatile, keeping data even when the power is switched off.</span></li>
      <li><span class="official-note">It can store more data than primary storage, but it is slower to access.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">All applications, the operating system, and user files such as documents, photos, and music are stored on secondary storage.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
      <li><div class="example-box">Saving to a USB memory stick: Files saved to a USB stick remain available after unplugging it, while unsaved work in RAM is lost when power is off. This illustrates non volatility of secondary storage.</div></li>
      <li><span class="fun-tip">Secondary storage is like a giant basement: you can keep everything there for years, but it takes longer to climb down and find it compared to grabbing something from your desk (RAM).</span></li>

    <h2>3.3c: Magnetic, optical, and solid state storage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a type of secondary storage that uses the properties of magnetism to store data.">magnetic storage</span> uses magnetism to store data on spinning circular disks called platters.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">Platters spin at high speed, and read or write heads with electromagnets move across the surfaces to store or retrieve data.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">The surfaces are organised into tracks and sectors, with each sector holding a fixed amount of data.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">A magnetised spot represents binary 1, and a demagnetised spot represents binary 0.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">Hard disk drives are a common type of magnetic storage.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">They can suffer from latency, the delay while the disk rotates the required data under the read or write head.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Files can become fragmented, with parts stored in non adjacent sectors, slowing down access. Defragmentation software can rearrange the data to speed things up.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a type of secondary storage that uses lasers to store data.">optical storage</span> uses laser light to read and write data on circular discs.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">Data is stored as pits and lands along a single spiral track from the centre of the disc to the edge.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">CDs and DVDs use a red laser, while Blu ray discs use a blue laser with a shorter wavelength, allowing smaller pits and higher capacity.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">DVDs can be dual layer, with two recording layers separated by a spacer to increase storage capacity. Blu ray discs can be single or dual layer, with capacities up to 50 GB.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Laser wavelengths and format examples: CD uses red light at about 780 nm, DVD uses red light at about 650 nm, and Blu ray uses blue light at about 405 nm. The shorter wavelength allows more data to fit.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">Solid state storage has no moving parts and uses <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="an electronic circuit, where transistors are set on a semiconductor material, such as silicon.">semiconductor chips</span> to store data.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">Data is stored in <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="the intersection of the rows and columns of transistors in solid-state storage.">cell</span> made of transistors arranged in a grid, with each cell containing a <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a component that controls the flow of electric current.">control gate</span> and a <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a component that can store electrical charge.">floating gate</span> separated by a dielectric layer.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">The floating gate holds an electrical charge for binary 1 or no charge for binary 0.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Solid state storage can use NAND or NOR structures to connect the cells.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Solid state storage is non volatile; it keeps data even when power is off.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">Examples of solid state storage devices include solid state drives and USB flash drives.</span></li>
      <li><span class="official-note">Advantages of solid state drives over hard disk drives include:</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">Faster access speeds and no rotational latency.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Greater reliability because there are no moving parts.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Lower power use and cooler operation, suitable for laptops.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Lighter weight and smaller size.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">A disadvantage of solid state drives is limited write endurance.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">Data must be erased before rewriting to the same location.</span></li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
      <li><div class="example-box">SSD vs HDD in one sentence: Because SSDs use floating gate transistors and no moving parts, they are typically faster and lighter than hard disk drives.</div></li>

        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">It is used when RAM becomes full, allowing more programs to run at the same time.</span></li>
        </ul>

      <li><span class="official-note">Drawbacks of using hard disk based virtual memory include slower performance because of disk thrashing.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">Disk thrashing occurs when frequent swapping between RAM and virtual memory causes a high number of read or write movements, reducing processing speed.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Excessive swapping, called disk thrashing, can also shorten the life of mechanical drives.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Using a solid state drive instead of a hard disk for virtual memory can reduce thrashing.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Adding more RAM or using a solid state drive can reduce virtual memory problems.</span></li>
