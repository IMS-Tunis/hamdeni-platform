    <h2>3.2a: Input Devices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">An input device is a piece of hardware that allows data to be entered into a computer system.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">The data entered may be in different forms, such as text, images, sound, or movement.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Input devices are essential for sending information into the computer so it can be processed.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Some input devices are used by humans (e.g., keyboard), while others like sensors are automatic and work in real-time environments.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">A <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a series of dark and light lines of varying thickness used to represent data; the code has to be scanned using laser or LED light source">barcode</span> scanner is used to read barcodes made of dark and light parallel lines that represent digits using specific patterns.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">Each digit has a unique pattern of thick and thin lines; digits on the left and right of the barcode use different codes to support two-way scanning.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">When scanned, the barcode reflects red light differently between dark and light areas, which is captured by sensors and turned into digital data.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">The barcode is looked up in a stock database where its record includes item name, price, quantity, and reorder level.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Barcode systems update stock levels and trigger automatic reordering when stock is low.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">A QR code (Quick Response code) is a square-shaped matrix of black and white blocks that can hold much more data than a traditional barcode.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">A QR code can store up to 4296 characters or 7089 digits, including web addresses or phone numbers.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">It includes three large alignment squares in the corners to help the scanner determine the position and angle of the code.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">QR codes are often scanned using smartphone or tablet cameras, and decoded by QR applications into readable information.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">QR codes use built-in error-checking so they are more reliable than traditional barcodes even if damaged.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">A digital camera captures light using a lens and a light-sensitive array of pixels called a CCD (charge-coupled device).</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">Each pixel converts light into an electric signal, which is sent to an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) to create a digital image.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Digital cameras also measure colour using 24-bit RGB: 8 bits each for red, green, and blue levels.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">More pixels mean higher image resolution and larger file size; quality also depends on the lens and <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a type of input device that is used to capture data from its immediate environment.">sensor</span>.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Images can be transferred to computers using USB or Bluetooth and stored in formats like JPEG or RAW.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">A keyboard is the most common method of entering text into a computer or device.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">Pressing a key completes a circuit that the CPU detects and matches to a character using its ASCII value.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Keyboards can be wired or wireless; virtual keyboards exist on phones and tablets using touch screens.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Repetitive use of keyboards may cause injuries such as RSI (repetitive strain injury), but ergonomic keyboards help reduce strain.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">A microphone captures sound by detecting air vibrations and converting them into an electric signal.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">Inside the microphone, a vibrating diaphragm causes a coil to move in a magnetic field, generating a current.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">This analogue signal is then converted to digital using an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) before the computer can store or process it.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Microphones can be built into the device or connected externally via USB or Bluetooth.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">An <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a pointing device that uses a red LED to track the movement of the device and then relays its coordinates to a computer">optical mouse</span> detects movement by capturing multiple images per second of the surface below it.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">A red LED reflects light from the surface; a CMOS sensor reads the pattern and a processor calculates movement.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Optical mice are more reliable than mechanical ones and can be used on most flat surfaces.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Wireless optical mice use Bluetooth, but wired ones avoid signal loss and don’t need batteries.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">Scanners convert physical documents or 3D objects into digital images for storage or processing.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">2D scanners use a CCD and light to scan flat pages, producing JPEG or editable text files using OCR (<span class="keyword" data-tooltip="technology that can convert hard copy text or images into a digital format to be stored in a computer memory">optical character recognition</span>).</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">3D scanners scan solid objects across x, y, and z dimensions, producing 3D models for CAD design or 3D printing.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">2D scanners are often used in airports to match passport photos with live images using face recognition software.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">The process of 2D scanning involves shining a light on the document, then using mirrors and lenses to reflect the image onto sensors, which convert it into digital format.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">A <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a screen that allows the user to select or manipulate a screen image using the touch of a finger or stylus; touch screens most frequently use capacitive, infra-red or resistive technology">touch screen</span> is an input device that detects user interaction through direct touch on the display surface.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">Capacitive screens use a conductive layer that detects changes in electric fields caused by fingers or special styluses.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">In a capacitive touchscreen, the screen stores electrical charge and detects coordinates when a finger touches the screen and completes the circuit.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Infrared screens detect when a beam of light is interrupted by touch.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Resistive screens consist of two layers that create a circuit when pressed together.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Touch screens are used in mobile phones, tablets, ATMs, and kiosks to allow direct interaction without a keyboard or mouse.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
      <li><div class="example-box">In supermarkets, barcode scanners are used to identify products during checkout. Each scan decreases the stock level in the database. When it reaches the reorder level, new stock is ordered automatically.</div></li>
      <li><div class="example-box">A QR code can link to a product website. When scanned by a mobile phone, it opens a webpage instantly without typing the URL. This is commonly used in advertisements, boarding passes, or menus.</div></li>
      <li><div class="example-box">When a photo is taken, the CCD captures brightness and colour of each pixel, like an orange pixel with values red=215, green=165, blue=40. This data is converted to binary and stored as a digital image.</div></li>
      <li><div class="example-box">When the letter ‘H’ is pressed, it completes a circuit that sends a signal to the computer, which uses a lookup table to match the signal to the ASCII code for &#x27;H&#x27;.</div></li>
      <li><div class="example-box">Saying “hut” into a microphone produces air vibrations that are turned into electric signals, then digitized into binary so the computer can store or edit the sound.</div></li>
      <li><div class="example-box">At airport immigration, a 2D scanner reads the passport photo and compares it with a real-time camera photo using software that measures face features like eye distance and jawline.</div></li>
      <li><div class="example-box">Projective capacitive screens used in modern smartphones allow multi-touch gestures (like zoom or scroll) and work with gloved hands or styluses.</div></li>

        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">DLP projectors use a chip with thousands of tiny mirrors (DMD) that reflect light to form an image.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">DLP mirrors tilt toward or away from light to produce light or dark pixels and switch rapidly to create greyscale and colour.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">LCD projectors use coloured mirrors and separate LCD panels for red, green, and blue. These combine to form a full-colour image.</span></li>

    <h2>3.2c: Sensors</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">A sensor is a special input device that detects physical changes in the environment and sends that information to a computer system.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">Sensors detect changes such as temperature, light, pressure, or movement and send continuous signals, not only when changes happen.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">The data captured by sensors is analogue, meaning it has many possible values and needs to be converted to digital using an ADC (analogue-to-digital converter).</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">In control systems, feedback is used: the output affects the next sensor reading, creating a loop that adjusts the system automatically.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Sensors do not make decisions—they simply send data to a microprocessor which then determines the appropriate action.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">Sensors are used in both monitoring systems (which observe and report) and control systems (which take action).</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">Monitoring systems only report when something is out of range, like a hospital monitor alerting a nurse.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Control systems adjust devices to bring the situation back to a desired level, like an air conditioner turning on when it&#x27;s too hot.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Monitoring systems can alert users when abnormal values are detected, while control systems use sensor data to automatically adjust the output to maintain desired conditions.</span></li>
