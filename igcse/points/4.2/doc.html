    <h2>4.2a: High-level and low-level languages</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="official-note">A <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a type of programming language that uses English-like commands.">high-level language</span> is a type of programming language that uses words similar to human language, such as "if", "print", or "input". These languages are designed to be easy to understand, write, and debug.</span>
        <ul>
          <li>High-level languages do not require knowledge of the computer’s hardware or instruction set.</li>
          <li>They are often <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a program that can be run on different types and manufacturers of computers.">portable</span>, meaning they can run on different types of computers.</li>
          <li>Portable programs run on different computers without modification, because the high-level language is not tied to a specific machine architecture.</li>
          <li>Programs written in high-level languages are generally easier to maintain over time.</li>
          <li>Once you learn one high-level language, many of the same programming techniques apply to others like Python, Java, Visual Basic, or Pascal.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="official-note">A <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a language closer to the machine's language, this could be assembly language or binary code.">low-level language</span> is closer to the computer's own language and is harder for humans to read and write.</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Low-level languages include machine code (binary) and <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="code written in mnemonics that allows direct manipulation of the hardware. It must be converted into binary code to run.">assembly language</span> (mnemonics).</li>
          <li>These languages are specific to a computer's hardware and cannot easily be used on other systems.</li>
          <li>They allow direct manipulation of the hardware, which can lead to faster and smaller programs.</li>
          <li>Reasons to use a low-level language include faster execution, smaller memory use, and the ability to directly control hardware or use special machine instructions.</li>
          <li>However, low-level programs take more time to develop and are more difficult to debug.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
      <li><div class="example-box">Example: High-Level vs Low-Level Code<br>The high-level instruction `Sum := FirstNumber + SecondNumber` is simple and clear. In assembly language, the same task might require:<br>```<br>LDA First<br>ADD Second<br>STO Sum<br>```<br>In <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="binary code, an example of a low-level language.">machine code</span>, this would become a set of binary or hexadecimal instructions like `0001 00010010`. This shows how high-level code is much easier to read and write.</div></li>
      <li><span class="fun-tip">Think of high-level languages like giving instructions to a friend: “Make me a sandwich.” Low-level languages are like saying, “Take two slices of bread, open the peanut butter jar, use a knife...” : more precise, but definitely more work!</span></li>

    <h2>4.2b: Assembly language and assembler</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="official-note">Assembly language is a type of low-level programming language that uses short commands (called mnemonics) to represent instructions.</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Examples of <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="instruction code used in assembly language.">mnemonics</span> include LDA (load), ADD (add), and STO (store), each of which performs a specific operation on memory or data.</li>
          <li>To understand and use assembly language, the programmer needs to know what each mnemonic means and how the hardware works.</li>
          <li>Understanding assembly often requires knowledge of hardware parts like the accumulator, which is a special register used to temporarily store values during calculations.</li>
          <li>Assembly language allows more control over memory use and performance, which can be useful for fast or memory-efficient programs.</li>
          <li>In most cases, one assembly instruction is directly mapped to one machine code instruction, giving the programmer precise control over hardware behavior.</li>
          <li>Assembly language must be translated into machine code before it can be executed.</li>
          <li>In assembly language, the programmer must define and manage the memory addresses of variables manually, which offers precision but increases complexity.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">A program called an assembler is used to convert assembly language instructions into machine code.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
      <li><div class="example-box">Example: Adding Numbers in Assembly<br>The following three assembly commands perform the same task as `Sum := FirstNumber + SecondNumber` in a high-level language:<br>```<br>LDA First<br>ADD Second<br>STO Sum<br>```<br>This shows how a single high-level command might require multiple assembly instructions.</div></li>
      <li><span class="fun-tip">If assembly language were a dance routine, mnemonics would be the choreographer’s shorthand: “LDA” means “Step left and pose!” It’s more readable than binary, but you still need to know the moves!</span></li>
      <li><div class="example-box">Example: High-Level Code in Python : `print("Hello!")` is easy to write and understand. It uses an English-like word, making programming feel more natural for beginners.</div></li>

    <h2>4.2c: Compilers and interpreters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="official-note">Computers only understand machine code, so programs written by humans must be translated before they can run.</span>
        <ul>
          <li>A translator is a utility program that converts human-readable code into machine code.</li>
          <li>Translators are categorized as compilers, interpreters, or assemblers, depending on the type of source code and how the translation occurs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="official-note">A compiler translates the entire program written in a high-level language into machine code all at once.</span>
        <ul>
          <li>If there are syntax errors, the <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a computer program that translates a source program written in a high-level language to machine code">compiler</span> stops and produces an error report.</li>
          <li>A compiler will only create an executable if there are no syntax errors in the program.</li>
          <li>The error report from a compiler usually includes the line numbers and the type of each error.</li>
          <li>If there are no errors, it creates an <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a file produced by a compiler that can be run independent of translator software and does not include the source code.">executable file</span> that can be run repeatedly without translating again. This file is ready for distribution and doesn't need the compiler or source code to run.</li>
          <li>Compiled programs do not need the source code or compiler to run, and the code is protected from being edited.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="official-note">An interpreter translates and runs one instruction at a time from a high-level language.</span>
        <ul>
          <li>If there is a syntax error, it stops immediately and shows an error message.</li>
          <li>Interpreted programs need to be translated every time they are run, which makes them slower.</li>
          <li>Interpreters are often used during development because they allow real-time testing and <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="finding errors in a computer program by running or tracing the program">debugging</span>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">An assembler is used to translate programs written in assembly language into machine code.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
      <li><div class="example-box">Example: Interpreter vs Compiler Error Reporting : When using an interpreter, the program stops at the first error, allowing immediate fixes. A compiler checks the whole program and shows a list of all errors at once. This means interpreters are more useful during debugging, while compilers are more efficient for finished programs.</div></li>
      <li><div class="example-box">Example: Compiler Output : A high-level command like `Sum := First + Second` may be translated to:<br>```<br>0001 00010010  ; load<br>0100 00010011  ; add<br>```<br>This shows how multiple binary instructions are produced from a single high-level line.</div></li>
      <li><span class="fun-tip">A compiler is like baking a cake and handing someone the finished product. An interpreter is like showing up with the ingredients and making the cake in front of them : every time they ask for a slice!</span></li>
      <li><div class="example-box">Example: One Instruction, Two Translators<br>If a program contains `Sum := FirstNumber + SecondNumber`, a compiler will convert the entire code into binary once. An <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a computer program that analyses and executes a program written in a high-level language line by line">interpreter</span> will instead read and run this line each time the program is used, making it slower but useful during testing.</div></li>

    <h2>4.2d: Advantages and disadvantages of compiler vs interpreter</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="official-note">Interpreters are more helpful during program development.</span>
        <ul>
          <li>They allow programs to be debugged and tested more quickly by running code line by line.</li>
          <li>The programmer can fix problems as they appear and continue testing from the same point.</li>
          <li>Interpreted programs are easier to edit and test before they are finished.</li>
          <li>Interpreters allow testing of incomplete programs, which helps developers find and fix errors early, even before the whole program is finished.</li>
          <li>An interpreter is useful for debugging because it allows the programmer to test small parts of the code quickly and fix problems as they appear.</li>
          <li>However, they require the interpreter software each time the program runs, and they are slower because they are retranslated every time.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="official-note">Compilers are more useful when the program is finished and ready for sharing or selling.</span>
        <ul>
          <li>The compiler translates the entire program into machine code and creates an executable file.</li>
          <li>The executable runs faster and does not need the compiler or source code to run.</li>

          <li>The executable file protects the source code from copying or editing.</li>
          <li>However, it takes more time to write, debug, and compile the program during development.</li>
        </ul>

      <li><span class="fun-tip">Using a compiler during development is like wrapping a present without checking what’s inside : risky! An interpreter lets you peek inside after every step, so surprises are less likely.</span></li>

    <h2>4.2e: Role and functions of an IDE</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="official-note">An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is software that helps programmers write, test, and run programs.</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Some IDEs support one programming language (like PyCharm for Python), while others support many (like Visual Studio).</li>
          <li>A code <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a feature of an IDE that allows the user to enter and amend program code.">editor</span> in the IDE allows the programmer to type and edit code directly.</li>
          <li>The IDE includes a translator (compiler or interpreter) so the program can be run and tested.</li>
          <li>The built-in <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="converts a program written in a high-level language program into machine code">translator</span> in an IDE works together with tools like error diagnostics, version control, and code navigation to help programming.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="official-note">Most IDEs also include debugging tools to help find and fix errors.</span>
        <ul>
          <li>A <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a feature of an IDE that allows a program to be run and lets the user interact with the program.">runtime environment</span> shows the program’s output while it runs.</li>
          <li>A debugger can:<br>- run the program line by line (single stepping)</li>
          <li>IDEs allow step-by-step (line-by-line) execution, which helps identify the exact location where logic errors occur during runtime.<br>- stop the program at chosen points (breakpoints)<br>- display current variable values (watch window)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">Many modern IDEs include version control tools, which allow programmers to track changes to their code, undo mistakes, and collaborate with others more easily.</span></li>
      <li>
        <span class="official-note">IDEs also help while writing code by detecting and correcting errors early.</span>
        <ul>
          <li>**Error diagnostics** shows mistakes as you type and may suggest fixes.</li>
          <li>**<span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a feature of an editor that gives the user options when they start typing a command.">auto-completion</span>** suggests keywords or variables while typing.</li>
          <li>**<span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a feature of an editor that identifies spelling errors and changes them.">auto-correction</span>** fixes common typing or syntax mistakes.</li>
          <li>**Auto-documentation** explains the purpose of different parts of code.</li>
          <li>IDEs may include extra features like bracket matching, version control systems, or auto-documentation tools to manage code changes and formatting.</li>
          <li>**<span class="keyword" data-tooltip="displaying source code using different colours and formatting, which make the code easier to read and understand">prettyprinting</span>** formats code and uses colors to make it easier to read.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
      <li><div class="example-box">Example: Multi-language IDE : Visual Studio supports C++, C#, and Python, while PyCharm focuses only on Python. This shows how some IDEs are designed for flexibility, while others are optimized for one language.</div></li>
      <li><div class="example-box">Example: IDE Auto-Correction : If you mistype `prin`, the IDE suggests `print()` and may fix the typo automatically. This helps reduce errors and saves time.</div></li>
      <li><div class="example-box">Example: Features of a Modern IDE<br>In Visual Studio, the code editor shows suggestions as you type (auto-completion), underlines mistakes in red (error diagnostics), and offers fixes (auto-correction).
