"question": "Describe two core functions performed by a network interface card when a device communicates on a network.",
"mark_scheme": "Answer:\n(Describe: state the points of a topic / give characteristics and main features)\n1) It establishes the physical connection and transmits and receives data.\n2) It converts between network data and computer-readable data."

"question": "Explain how a NIC enables IP assignment in a home network.",
"mark_scheme": "Answer:\n(Explain: set out purposes or reasons / make the relationships between things evident / provide why and/or how and support with relevant evidence)\nThe NIC provides network connectivity so the home router’s DHCP server can allocate a private IP address to the device on the LAN. Separately, the ISP allocates the router’s public IP address."

"point_id": "3.4b",
"question_number": 5,
"question": "Describe the structure and format of a MAC address.",
"mark_scheme": "Answer:\n(Describe: state the points of a topic / give characteristics and main features)\nA MAC address is 48 bits written as six pairs of hexadecimal digits separated by colons or dashes. It comprises a manufacturer identifier and a device-specific identifier."

"point_id": "3.4b",
"question_number": 6,
"question": "Identify who assigns a device’s MAC address and when.",
"mark_scheme": "Answer:\n(Identify: name/select/recognise)\nThe manufacturer assigns it at the time of manufacture."
},

"point_id": "3.4b",
"question_number": 7,
"question": "Explain the difference between a universally administered address and a locally administered address.",
"mark_scheme": "Answer:\n(Explain: set out purposes or reasons / make the relationships between things evident / provide why and/or how and support with relevant evidence)\nA universally administered address is the default manufacturer-set MAC address for the device. A locally administered address is a user or administrator override of the MAC address for specific network requirements."

"question_number": 8,
"question": "Describe two structural differences between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.",
"mark_scheme": "Answer:\n(Describe: state the points of a topic / give characteristics and main features)\nIPv4 uses 32 bits written as four decimal numbers separated by full stops. IPv6 uses 128 bits written as hexadecimal groups separated by colons."

"question": "Explain the difference between static and dynamic IP addresses and who assigns them on the internet.",
"mark_scheme": "Answer:\n(Explain: set out purposes or reasons / make the relationships between things evident / provide why and/or how and support with relevant evidence)\nA static IP address does not change and is assigned by the ISP for consistent addressing. A dynamic IP address is assigned by the ISP using DHCP and can change when a device reconnects."

"question_number": 12,
"question": "Describe how a router forwards data on a local network compared with forwarding to the internet.",
"mark_scheme": "Answer:\n(Describe: state the points of a topic / give characteristics and main features)\nWithin the same local network, forwarding uses MAC addresses to deliver frames to the correct device. When sending data between networks, forwarding uses destination IP addresses to route packets beyond the local network."
},
{
"point_id": "3.4d",
"question_number": 13,
"question": "Explain routing decisions in packet switching.",
"mark_scheme": "Answer:\n(Explain: set out purposes or reasons / make the relationships between things evident / provide why and/or how and support with relevant evidence)\nRouters make per-packet, per-hop forwarding decisions, so different packets from the same message can take different paths based on available routes."
},
{
"point_id": "3.4c",
"question_number": 14,
"question": "Describe two differences between a MAC address and an IP address.",
"mark_scheme": "Answer:\n(Describe: state the points of a topic / give characteristics and main features)\n1) A MAC address is assigned by the manufacturer and uniquely identifies the network interface on the local network. An IP address is assigned by the network or ISP and identifies the device’s network location.\n2) A MAC address uses 48 bits in hexadecimal pairs. An IP address uses 32 bits in IPv4 or 128 bits in IPv6."

"point_id": "3.4c",
"question_number": 15,
"question": "Describe the structure of an IPv4 address.",
"mark_scheme": "Answer:\n(Describe: state the points of a topic / give characteristics and main features)\nIt is 32 bits long and written as four decimal numbers separated by full stops. Each number ranges from 0 to 255. Example: 12.244.233.165."

"point_id": "3.4d",
"question_number": 16,
"question": "State the role of a router in a network.",
"mark_scheme": "Answer:\n(State: express in clear terms)\nA router reads the destination address in each data packet and forwards it to the correct destination, connecting a local network to other networks or the internet."
