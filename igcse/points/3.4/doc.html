    <h2>3.4c: Internet protocol (IP) address; types; IPv4 vs IPv6</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">An internet protocol (IP) address is used to locate a device on a network and is allocated by the network. </span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">IPv4 uses 32 bits and is written as four numbers separated by full stops; IPv6 uses 128 bits and is written in hexadecimal groups separated by colons. </span></li>
        </ul>

          <li><span class="official-note">IPv4 number range: each of the four numbers is from 0 to 255. </span></li>

      <li><div class="example-box">IPv4 validity check: 10.245.3.99 has four numbers separated by full stops and each number is between 0 and 255, so it is valid. </div></li>
      <li><div class="example-box">Static IP in practice: a website server may use a static IPv4 address so users can always reach the same address. </div></li>
      <li><span class="fun-tip">An IP address is like where you live. Static IP is a fixed home address, dynamic IP is a hotel room that can change the next time you visit. </span></li>

    <h2>3.4d: Role of a router in a network</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">A router reads a destination address and forwards data to the correct destination; it connects a local network to the internet. </span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">On a local network, the router can assign IP addresses to devices. </span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Forwarding on a local network can use MAC addresses; forwarding to the internet uses IP addresses. </span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">In packet switching, routers make per-packet, per-hop forwarding decisions. Different packets can take different paths when routing information indicates a more efficient path. </span></li>

      <li><div class="example-box">Home network: devices connect to the router, which forwards data and can assign local IP addresses.</div></li>
      <li><span class="fun-tip">A router works like a post office sorter. It reads the destination and sends each parcel on a good route, switching paths when another route is faster.</span></li>
