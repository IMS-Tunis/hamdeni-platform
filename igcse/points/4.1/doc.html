      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="official-note">The OS manages memory by controlling data movement between RAM (Random Access Memory, a type of temporary storage) and permanent storage, ensuring applications have enough memory, and preventing memory conflicts.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">Managing memory involves allocating memory to different processes, preventing processes from accessing each other’s memory, and freeing up memory when processes complete.</span></li>

      <li>
        <span class="official-note">The OS manages <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a function that allows a computer to process more than one task/process at a time">multitasking</span> by allowing multiple applications to run simultaneously, allocating resources efficiently, and switching tasks as needed.</span>

      <li>
        <span class="official-note">The <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a program that manages the computer, allows the user to communicate with the computer, and allows software to be run">OS</span> manages system security, user accounts, and access rights.

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="official-note">The OS provides a platform for running applications by loading applications into memory and managing their execution.</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
      <li><div class="example-box">Voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri allow users to speak normal commands, interpreting the spoken words to carry out tasks without requiring technical commands or syntax knowledge.</div></li>
      <li><div class="example-box">Memory conflict prevention: The OS stops a game and a word processor from overwriting each other’s data in RAM.</div></li>
      <li><span class="fun-tip">Imagine your OS as a super-busy party host. It takes coats (stores files), introduces guests (connects devices), stops arguments (memory conflicts), and ensures everyone gets a slice of cake (CPU time). And when the music stops suddenly, that’s an “interrupt” telling the host to fix the speaker!</span></li>
