    "mark_scheme": "Answer:\n(Explain: set out purposes or reasons / make the relationships between things evident / provide why and/or how and support with relevant evidence)\nAn interrupt is generated by hardware (e.g., pressing a key) or software (e.g., division by zero). After finishing the current fetch-decode-execute cycle, the processor checks the interrupt queue, saves the current taskâ€™s state, executes the corresponding Interrupt Service Routine (ISR), then resumes the previous task."

    "question": "Describe how buffers and interrupts work together when printing a document.",
    "mark_scheme": "Answer:\n(Describe: state the points of a topic / give characteristics and main features)\nWhen printing, data is sent to a buffer. The slower printer prints from the buffer. If more data is needed, the device sends an interrupt to the processor, which responds while continuing other tasks."
