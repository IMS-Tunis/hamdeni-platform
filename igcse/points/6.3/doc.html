<li><span class="official-note">AI simulates <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="The mental processes of the human brain such as reasoning, learning, perception, and speech">Cognitive functions</span>.</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">AI is evaluated based on how well it performs tasks that are normally carried out by humans, such as speaking, recognizing images, or solving problems.</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">AI systems can be categorized into three types:</span>
<ul>
<li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="AI that outperforms humans at one specific task, such as playing chess">Narrow AI</span></span></li>
<li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="AI that performs at a similar level to humans on a specific task">General AI</span></span></li>

</ul></li>
<li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="The ability of a machine to mimic intelligent human behavior">Simulated intelligence</span> is the core idea behind AI.</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A test proposed by Alan Turing to determine if a machine can imitate human responses">Turing Test</span> checks whether a human can distinguish between responses from a person and an AI.</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">AI is often described as a collection of <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="Instructions a machine follows to make decisions">Rules</span>, <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="Information used by the system">Data</span>, and the ability to reason, learn, and adapt to its environment.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="no-bullets">
<li><div class="example-box"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="AI systems that interpret human language">Natural language systems</span> can answer differently phrased questions like “When does the sun set today?” or “What time is sunset?” by identifying the intended meaning and responding accurately.</div></li>
<li><div class="example-box">Smart home devices like Alexa or Siri use <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="The ability of a machine to understand spoken language">Speech recognition</span> to take commands, learn user preferences, and improve future responses.</div></li>
<li><div class="example-box">Chatbots simulate conversation by analyzing user input and generating appropriate replies, allowing them to interact with users in real time.</div></li>
<li><div class="example-box"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="An AI process for identifying human emotions based on facial features">Facial expression recognition</span> works by detecting the positions of eyebrows, eyes, and mouth to determine emotions like joy, anger, or surprise.</div></li>

<h2>6.3b: Describe the main characteristics of AI</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="official-note">AI systems often share four key features that support intelligent decision-making:</span>
<ul>
<li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="The process of gathering input for the system, either from users or from sensors such as cameras or microphones">Data collection</span></span></li>
<li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A collection of predefined instructions or logic used to guide decisions within the system">Rules base</span></span></li>
<li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="The ability to use logic and rules to draw new conclusions from known information">Reasoning</span></span></li>
<li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="The ability of the system to improve or change its decision-making rules based on experience or new data">Learning and adaptation</span></span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A sub-field of AI that enables machines to learn from data and improve performance without explicit reprogramming">Machine learning</span> allows AI systems to adapt over time.</span>
<ul>
<li><span class="official-note">Machine learning involves training a system with data so it can recognize patterns and make decisions.</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">There are two main types of machine learning:</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A type of machine learning where the system is trained with labeled data and examples">Supervised learning</span></span></li>
<li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A type of machine learning where the system finds patterns in data without human-provided labels">Unsupervised learning</span></span></li>
<li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A method used in unsupervised learning to group similar data points based on shared features">Clustering</span> is commonly used to reveal hidden structure in the data.</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A technique used in recommendation systems to suggest items based on similar users’ preferences">Collaborative filtering</span> allows the AI to make suggestions even without direct input from the user.</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">An expert system contains three essential components: the <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A storage area for expert-level facts">Knowledge base</span>, the <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A set of IF-THEN rules for applying logic">Rule base</span>, and the <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="The system’s reasoning module that applies the rules to reach decisions">Inference engine</span>. It also includes a <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="The method by which the user communicates with the expert system">User interface</span>.</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">A robot with machine learning capabilities can adjust its internal rules, data, or processes based on past experience.</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">A robot using machine learning becomes more efficient over time because it:</span>
<ul>
<li><span class="official-note">Learns from its environment (for example, by remembering where obstacles are)</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">Can recall where to begin and end tasks like planting seeds</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">Reduces its error rate by applying what it has learned from earlier actions</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="official-note">AI systems can be summarized by three key capabilities:</span>
<ul>
<li><span class="official-note">Collect data and use rules to make decisions</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">Use logic and reasoning to develop new conclusions</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">Learn and adapt their behavior over time</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="official-note">AI simulates <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="Human mental processes such as perception, learning, memory, and decision-making">Cognitive functions</span>, enabling machines to operate intelligently.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="no-bullets">
<li><div class="example-box">A robot using <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="Sensors that detect proximity or obstacles">Infra-red sensors</span> might collect data and follow a rule like: "If an obstacle is detected, turn right."</div></li>
<li><div class="example-box">An AI might apply logical reasoning: “All dogs eat meat. Fred is a dog. Therefore, Fred eats meat.” This shows how the AI uses known rules to make new conclusions.</div></li>
<li><div class="example-box">In <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="An application of machine learning to detect unwanted emails">Spam filtering</span>, the system learns from labeled examples and flags future messages containing common spam keywords such as “lottery” or “earn.”</div></li>
<li><div class="example-box">In <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="The use of machine learning to suggest items to users">Product recommendation</span>, the system compares your shopping behavior with others to recommend similar products.</div></li>
<li><div class="example-box"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="Using machine learning to identify suspicious transactions">Fraud detection</span> works by analyzing spending patterns and flagging unusual behavior, such as an expensive jewelry purchase.</div></li>
<li><div class="example-box">A search engine improves its ranking system using machine learning. If most users click a result on page 1, it is marked as useful and ranked higher in the future.</div></li>
<li><span class="fun-tip">Think of machine learning like a kid learning to ride a bike. The more it falls, the better it gets!</span></li>
<li><span class="fun-tip">Supervised learning is like teaching a dog tricks with treats. Unsupervised learning is your dog figuring out how to open the fridge on its own!</span></li>
<li><span class="fun-tip">AI collecting data is like a robot keeping a diary — it remembers everything it senses to improve its decisions later.</span></li>

</ul></li>
<li><span class="official-note">Some expert systems include an <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A module that explains the reasoning behind the system’s diagnosis or advice to the user">Explanation system</span>.</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">An expert system works by following these steps:</span>
<ul>
<li><span class="official-note">Taking input (such as symptoms or user observations) through the interface</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">Using the inference engine to compare user input with known facts in the knowledge base</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">Applying logic from the rules base to reach a decision or diagnosis</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">Presenting results, advice, or probabilities to the user</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">Optionally asking more questions to refine the outcome</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="official-note">The <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="The expert system’s main processor">Inference engine</span>:</span>
<ul>
<li><span class="official-note">Applies IF-THEN rules to known data</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">Draws conclusions or diagnoses based on reasoning</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">Decides if more input is needed to improve the result</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="official-note">A complete expert system also:</span>
<ul>
<li><span class="official-note">Uses the interface to receive input and display results</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">Combines logic from the rules base with facts from the knowledge base</span></li>

<li><span class="official-note">Can store and access vast amounts of information</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">Offer unbiased decisions based purely on logic</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="official-note">Disadvantages of expert systems include:</span>
<ul>
<li><span class="official-note">Require considerable user training to operate properly</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">Setup and maintenance costs are high</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">Responses may feel impersonal or “cold,” especially in sensitive contexts like medical care</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">The system’s performance depends entirely on the quality of its input data</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">Users may falsely assume the system is infallible and accept incorrect advice</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="official-note">Expert systems are also used in:</span>
<ul>
<li><span class="official-note">Oil and mineral exploration</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">Tax calculation and financial advising</span></li>
<li><span class="official-note">Fault detection in electronics</span></li>

<ul class="no-bullets">
<li><div class="example-box">In a <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="An AI used to support medical diagnosis">Medical expert system</span>, the system asks about symptoms, searches its knowledge base, and provides a possible diagnosis with a confidence percentage. For example: “Based on symptoms, there is a 21% probability of mercury poisoning.”</div></li>
<li><div class="example-box">A printer troubleshooting system might ask: “Is the green light on?” If not, it recommends turning on the power. If yes, it moves to a different question based on this response.</div></li>
<li><div class="example-box">A rule in the rules base might be: IF continent = “South America” AND language = “Portuguese” THEN country = “Brazil”.</div></li>
<li><div class="example-box">In a reasoning task, if a system is given the facts: “It is a mammal. It is not a pet. It lives in water. It makes sonic sounds. It has skin. It has no legs,” it will identify the object as a whale.</div></li>
<li><span class="fun-tip">An expert system is like a super-serious quiz master — it always knows the next question to ask based on your answers.</span></li>
<li><span class="fun-tip">The inference engine is the “AI Sherlock Holmes” — it pieces together clues and draws logical conclusions.</span></li>
