    "question": "The robot is adapted to have machine learning capabilities.\nExplain how this will improve the robot.",
    "answer": "• The robot can now adapt itself by changing its own rules/data/ processes\n• The robot will become more efficient\n• … as it has a greater knowledge of its surroundings/environment\n• … as it can remember where a fence is\n• … as it can remember the route it needs to take\n• … as it can remember where any obstacles are to avoid\n• … as it can remember where to start and stop sowing seeds\n• … as it may make fewer errors"

  {
    "question": "Explain how the expert system operates and how it is used to help diagnose the problem.",
    "answer": "• User inputs symptoms via the interface\n• The inference engine searches the knowledge base\n• … applies the rule base to the symptoms\n• A diagnosis is made\n• … which is output to the user\n• System may ask follow-up questions to refine the diagnosis"
