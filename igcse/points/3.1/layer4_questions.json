    "question": "Describe the role of the CPU in the computer.",
    "answer": "• Controls all the other parts of the computer\n• Executes programs / instructions\n• Fetches, decodes and executes instructions\n• Carries out processing / arithmetic and logic operations\n(Max 2 marks)"
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe the role of the microprocessor in the system and how it checks whether the parking cost has been paid.",
    "answer": "• Microprocessor checks if sensor is activated (1)\n• Microprocessor compares time the car has been parked against time paid (1)\n• If time parked > time paid, then trigger signal to output (e.g. barrier/alert) (1)\n(Max 3 marks)"
  },
  {
    "question": "State the name of the CPU component that sends signals to manage the fetch-decode-execute cycle.",
    "answer": "• Control unit"

  {
    "question": "(i) State the purpose of a register.\n(ii) Give three CPU registers.\n(iii) Describe the purpose of the ALU.",
    "answer": "(i) Temporary data store / stores data or instruction being processed\n(ii) Any three from: MAR, MDR, CIR, PC, ACC\n(iii) Performs arithmetic and logic operations"
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe the role of the MAR.",

  },
  {
    "question": "Explain why a different CPU can increase performance.",
    "answer": "• Higher clock speed – more instructions per second\n• More cores – multiple instructions processed simultaneously\n• Larger cache – more data stored closer to CPU\n(Any two for max 2)"
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain the purpose of cache in the CPU.",
    "answer": "• Stores frequently used instructions or data\n• Reduces time needed to access memory\n• Speeds up processing"
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain the effect of increasing clock speed from 2.4 GHz to 3.5 GHz on CPU performance.",
    "answer": "• Higher clock speed allows more instructions per second to be executed\n• Speeds up processing\n• Increases overall performance"
  },
  {
    "question": "State the name of the list of machine code commands processed by the CPU.",
    "answer": "• Instruction set"
  },
  {
    "question": "Define the term instruction set.",
    "answer": "• The complete set of instructions understood/executed by a CPU\n• Written in machine code / binary\n• Instructions used in programs\n(Max 2 marks)"
