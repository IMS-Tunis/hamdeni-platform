  <h2>3.1a: Role of the CPU and Microprocessor</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">The <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a component in a computer system that processes data and instructions">central processing unit (CPU)</span>, also called a <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="an integrated circuit that is able to perform many of the functions of a CPU">microprocessor</span> or processor, is the main part of the computer that processes all data and instructions, similar to the brain in a human body.</span>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">It is found in all modern devices like PCs, tablets, and smartphones, often built into a single <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="usually a chip made from a semiconductor material which carries out the same tasks as a larger circuit made from individual components">integrated circuit</span>.</span></li>
      <li><span class="official-note">The CPU usually contains three key parts: the <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="the component in the CPU that controls all the operations in the CPU">control unit</span> (CU), the <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="the component in the CPU that performs all the mathematical and logical operations required when processing data and instructions">arithmetic and logic unit (ALU)</span>, and <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a temporary component in the CPU which can be general or specific in its use">registers</span> connected through buses.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    <li><span class="official-note">In smaller electronic systems, like washing machines or traffic lights, a similar component called a microprocessor is used.</span>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">These microprocessors are part of <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a computer system that performs a dedicated function">embedded systems</span>, which are designed to carry out one specific task rather than multiple ones.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<ul class="no-bullets">
<li><div class="example-box">A washing machine uses a microprocessor to control dedicated tasks like selecting and executing wash cycles.</div></li>
<li><span class="fun-tip">If your brain had a CPU, it would be like your personal assistant - sorting tasks, solving math, and making sure you don‚Äôt forget lunch. A washing machine‚Äôs microprocessor is like a helper that just knows how to do laundry - nothing else!</span></li>
<li><div class="example-box">Example: In a parking system, a microprocessor checks if a sensor is activated, compares how long a car has been parked against the time paid, and sends a signal to an output device (like a barrier) if the time is exceeded.</div></li>

  <h2>3.1b: Von Neumann Architecture, CPU Components, FDE Cycle</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">The <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a type of computer architecture which introduced the concept of the stored program in the 1940s">Von Neumann architecture</span> is a design model where both data and programs are stored in memory and processed by a central CPU using a repeated <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="the cycle through which data and instructions are processed">Fetch‚ÄìDecode‚ÄìExecute (FDE) cycle</span>.</span>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">The architecture uses a system of components including: <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a component in the CPU that stores the address of the next instruction to be processed">Program Counter (PC)</span>, <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a component in the CPU that holds the address of the data or instruction to be located in RAM">Memory Address Register (MAR)</span>, <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a component in the CPU that holds the data or instruction that are fetched from RAM">Memory Data Register (MDR)</span>, <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a register that stores the current instruction being decoded and executed">Current Instruction Register (CIR)</span>, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a register that is built into the ALU that stores the result of any interim calculations">Accumulator (ACC)</span>, Control Unit (CU), and the <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="produces timing signals on the control bus to ensure synchronisation takes place">system clock</span>.</span></li>
      <li><span class="official-note">The CPU connects to memory and devices using three main <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a connection between major components in a computer that can carry data, addresses or control signals">system buses</span>:
  - <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="wires used for the transmission of addresses between components in a computer">Address bus</span>: sends memory locations in one direction (<span class="keyword" data-tooltip="can travel in one direction only; used to describe data">unidirectional</span>)
  - <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="wires used for the transmission of data and instructions between components in a computer">Data bus</span>: sends and receives data (<span class="keyword" data-tooltip="can travel in both directions; used to describe data">bidirectional</span>)
  - <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="wires used for the transmission of control signals between components in a computer">Control bus</span>: sends control signals (usually bidirectional)</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    <li><span class="official-note">The Fetch stage involves several steps:
  - The PC stores the address of the next instruction and sends it to the MAR using the address bus.
  - The instruction at that address is copied from <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="memory that holds all data and programs needed to be accessed by the control unit">immediate access store (IAS)</span> into the MDR.
  - The MDR passes the instruction to the CIR, where it is ready to be decoded.
  - The PC is incremented by 1 to point to the next instruction.</span>
  </li>
    <li><span class="official-note">In the Decode stage, the CIR uses the instruction set to decode the instruction so the CPU understands what to do.</span>
  </li>
    <li><span class="official-note">In the Execute stage, the CU sends control signals to carry out the decoded instruction. If calculations are needed, the ALU performs them using the ACC.</span>
  </li>
  </ul>
<ul class="no-bullets">
<li><div class="example-box">Reading from RAM:
  MAR holds address 1111 0001 ‚Üí RAM sends data 0101 1011 to MDR.
  Why it matters: Shows how CPUs find and process instructions step-by-step.</div></li>
<li><span class="fun-tip">Think of the fetch-decode-execute cycle like ordering pizza: You look up the pizza (fetch), read the recipe (decode), and cook it (execute). The CPU does this millions of times per second - but sadly, no pizza at the end.</span></li>

  <h2>üîπ 3.1c: Core, Cache, and Clock - Factors Affecting Performance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">CPU performance is about how quickly the CPU can carry out instructions, and it's affected by three main things: <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="the number of fetch-decode-execute cycles that can be performed in a second">clock speed</span>, number of <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="the part of the CPU that contains all the components that are used to perform the fetch-decode-execute cycle">cores</span>, and size of <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a type of storage that is built into the CPU, to store the most frequently used data and instructions">cache</span>.</span>
  </li>
    <li><span class="official-note">The clock speed is measured in gigahertz (GHz) and tells how many <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="clock speeds are measured in terms of GHz; this is the vibrational frequency of the system clock which sends out pulses along the control bus">clock cycles</span> can be completed per second. A faster clock can increase processing speed but may also cause overheating or errors if pushed beyond safe limits (<span class="keyword" data-tooltip="changing the clock speed of a system clock to a value higher than the factory/recommended setting">overclocking</span>).</span>
  </li>
    <li><span class="official-note">Cores are individual processors within the CPU. More cores allow more instructions to be processed at the same time.</span>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">A <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a CPU containing two cores">dual-core</span> CPU can process two instructions at once; a <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a CPU containing four cores">quad-core</span> can do four, allowing multitasking.</span></li>
      <li><span class="official-note">However, more cores don‚Äôt always double performance because the CPU must coordinate communication between cores.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    <li><span class="official-note">Cache is high-speed memory inside the CPU that stores frequently used data and instructions.</span>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">Using cache is faster than accessing RAM, so more cache generally means better performance-up to a point.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<ul class="no-bullets">
<li><div class="example-box">Example: Increasing clock speed from 2.4 GHz to 3.5 GHz improves CPU performance by allowing more instructions per second to be executed, speeding up processing and improving responsiveness.</div></li>
<li><div class="example-box">A 2.4 GHz dual-core CPU processes 4.8 billion instructions/second:
  Calculation: 2.4 billion cycles/core √ó 2 cores = 4.8 billion.
  Why it matters: Shows how cores and speed multiply performance.</div></li>
<li><span class="fun-tip">More cores in a CPU are like more chefs in a kitchen - they can cook faster, but only if they don‚Äôt bump into each other. And cache is like a spice rack on the counter - faster than running to the pantry (RAM)!</span></li>

  <h2>üîπ 3.1d: Instruction Set</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">An <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a set of commands that can be processed by a certain CPU">instruction set</span> is a list of all low-level machine code commands a CPU can understand and execute.</span>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">Each instruction consists of an <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="part of a machine code instruction that identifies what action the CPU has to perform">opcode</span> (the action to be performed) and an <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="part of a machine code instruction that identifies what data is to be used">operand</span> (the data or location the action applies to).</span></li>
      <li><span class="official-note">Software written in high-level programming languages is translated into these low-level instructions by compilers or interpreters.</span></li>

  </li>
  </ul>
<ul class="no-bullets">
<li><div class="example-box">The X86 instruction set (used in Intel CPUs) allows different computers to run the same software.</div></li>
<li><span class="fun-tip">An instruction set is like a language your CPU speaks. If you shout ‚ÄúWash the dishes!‚Äù at your toaster, it won‚Äôt respond - wrong instruction set. CPUs need the right opcodes to do the job!</span></li>

  <h2>üîπ 3.1e: Embedded Systems</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">An embedded system is a computer system built into a larger device to perform one specific, dedicated function.</span>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">Most embedded systems are not easy to reprogram and are designed to carry out their specific tasks reliably without frequent updates.</span></li>
      <li><span class="official-note">Embedded systems may include microcontrollers (with CPU, RAM, ROM on a chip), microprocessors (CPU only), or SoC (System on Chip) that combines everything.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    <li><span class="official-note">Embedded systems are used in devices like washing machines, GPS units, security alarms, vending machines, lighting systems, and medical equipment.</span>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">They may take input from sensors (e.g., temperature, pressure), process it, and give outputs such as displaying information or controlling motors.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    <li><span class="official-note">Some embedded systems are programmable (software can be updated), while others are fixed and need replacement if outdated.</span>
  </li>
    <li><span class="official-note">Embedded systems are used in devices like washing machines, GPS units, security alarms, vending machines, lighting systems, and medical equipment.</span>
  </li>
  </ul>
<ul class="no-bullets">
<li><div class="example-box">A car‚Äôs ABS braking system:
  Inputs: Sensors detecting wheel speed.
  Output: Adjusts brake pressure instantly.</div></li>
<li><div class="example-box">Example: A vending machine uses sensors to read coin values and temperatures and actuators to release snacks. All of this is controlled by an embedded system, making the machine work automatically.</div></li>
<li><div class="example-box">Example: A smartwatch is not a general-purpose computer because it is built for limited, specific functions like fitness tracking or notifications and cannot run a wide range of software like a laptop or desktop computer.</div></li>
<li><span class="fun-tip">An embedded system is like that friend who only talks about one thing - cars, games, or cake. They‚Äôre great at that one thing, but don‚Äôt expect them to help with your math homework.</span></li>
