    <h2>2.3a: Understand the need for and purpose of encryption when transmitting data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">Encryption protects data sent over networks by converting readable text into unreadable ciphertext so only the intended recipient can make sense of it; it reduces the impact of interception but does not stop interception itself.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">The original readable data is called plaintext, and after an encryption algorithm is applied the result is called ciphertext.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">An encryption algorithm uses a key to scramble plaintext into ciphertext, and the receiving device uses the appropriate key to decrypt the ciphertext back into plaintext.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Security protocol example: SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protects data in transit by combining encryption with digital certificates for authentication.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
      <li><div class="example-box">Example: sensitive data to encrypt in transit. Credit card or bank details, medical records, and legal documents should be encrypted when sent across public networks because intercepted messages would otherwise reveal confidential information.</div></li>
      <li><div class="example-box">Interception view of ciphertext. If a hacker intercepts encrypted data during transmission, they see scrambled text like &quot;GQVQ...&quot; instead of &quot;COMPUTER,&quot; which shows why encrypted data is unreadable without the correct key.</div></li>
      <li><span class="fun-tip">Postcard vs locked envelope. An unencrypted message is like a postcard anyone on the route can read, while an encrypted message is like a sealed envelope locked with a key that only the intended reader can open.</span></li>

    <h2>2.3b: Understand how data is encrypted using symmetric and asymmetric encryption</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">Symmetric encryption uses a single shared key for both encryption and decryption.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">Typical flow: encrypt the plaintext with the shared key to produce ciphertext, send the ciphertext and provide the same shared key to the receiver in a separate message, then the receiver uses that shared key to decrypt the ciphertext back to plaintext.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Main drawback: the single shared key must be transmitted to the receiver, which creates a risk of interception and makes keeping the key secret difficult.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
      <li><div class="example-box">Example: digit-shift illustration of symmetric encryption. A 10-digit key such as 4 2 9 1 3 6 2 8 5 6 can instruct how far to shift each letter to form ciphertext; applying the reverse shifts with the same key decrypts the message.</div></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">Asymmetric encryption uses two related keys: a public key that is shared and a private key that is kept secret; data encrypted with the public key is decrypted with the matching private key.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">Communication steps: the sender obtains the recipient’s public key and encrypts the plaintext; the recipient uses their private key to decrypt the received ciphertext.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">One-to-many communication: a person can share their public key with many senders; each sender uses that public key to encrypt a message, and only the private key owner can decrypt the received ciphertext.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Asymmetric encryption was designed to overcome the key sharing risk in symmetric encryption, because no secret key needs to be sent over the network.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Security comparison: symmetric approaches are generally less secure than asymmetric approaches because a single shared key must be distributed.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
      <li><div class="example-box">Example: online banking with public and private keys. Banks use asymmetric encryption to protect sensitive online transaction data; senders encrypt using the bank’s public key and the bank decrypts with its private key, illustrating how confidentiality is maintained without sharing a secret key.</div></li>
      <li><span class="fun-tip">Public padlocks and a private key. Imagine you hand out open padlocks to everyone. Anyone can lock a box for you with those padlocks (public keys), but only you have the single key that opens them (your private key).</span></li>
