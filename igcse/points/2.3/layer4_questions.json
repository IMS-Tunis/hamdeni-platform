    "question": "Explain how data is encrypted using symmetric encryption.",
    "answer": "Data is encrypted and decrypted using the same key (1 mark)\nAny three from:\n• Plain text is encrypted into cipher text // cipher text is decrypted into plain text\n• Data is encrypted using an algorithm …\n• …  that uses a key\n• The key can be generated using an algorithm\n• The key is transmitted to the receiver"
