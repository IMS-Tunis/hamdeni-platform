    "question": "Explain the difference between how HTTP and HTTPS operate to provide access to a website.",
    "mark_scheme": "HTTP is a protocol used to transfer web pages and data between a browser and a web server. HTTPS adds a layer of security by encrypting the data using SSL or TLS. The browser requests a digital certificate from the server, verifies it with a certificate authority, and then establishes an encrypted connection."

    "question_number": 6,
    "question": "Explain why HTTPS is more secure than HTTP.",
    "mark_scheme": "HTTPS encrypts data using SSL/TLS protocols and authenticates websites via digital certificates, preventing interception of sensitive information (e.g., passwords). HTTP lacks encryption, making data vulnerable to theft."
