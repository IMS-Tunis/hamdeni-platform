  <h2>1.3a: Understand how data storage is measured</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">Data size is measured with basic units that build on each other.</span>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="official-note">A <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="the basic computing element that is either 0 or 1, and is formed from the words Binary digit">bit</span> is the smallest unit of data and has a value of 0 or 1.</span></li>
        <li><span class="official-note">A nibble is 4 bits.</span></li>
        <li><span class="official-note">A byte is 8 bits.</span></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><span class="official-note">Larger units use 1024 multiples and follow a fixed pattern.</span>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="official-note">1 kibibyte (KiB) is 1024 bytes.</span></li>
        <li><span class="official-note">1 mebibyte (MiB) is 1024 KiB.</span></li>
        <li><span class="official-note">1 gibibyte (GiB) is 1024 MiB.</span></li>
        <li><span class="official-note">1 tebibyte (TiB) is 1024 GiB.</span></li>
        <li><span class="official-note">1 pebibyte (PiB) is 1024 TiB.</span></li>
        <li><span class="official-note">1 exbibyte (EiB) is 1024 PiB.</span></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul class="no-bullets">
    <li><div class="example-box">Converting GiB to bytes<br>Start value: 64 GiB.<br>Step 1 (GiB → MiB): 64 × 1024 = 65 536 MiB.<br>Step 2 (MiB → KiB): 65 536 × 1024 = 67 108 864 KiB.<br>Step 3 (KiB → bytes): 67 108 864 × 1024 = 68 719 476 736 bytes.<br>This shows how multiplying by 1024 at each step converts to the next smaller unit until we reach bytes.</div></li>
  </ul>
  <ul class="no-bullets">
    <li><div class="example-box">Converting between units<br>Case A (KiB → MiB): 512 KiB ÷ 1024 = 0.5 MiB (divide by 1024 to move up one unit).<br>Case B (GiB → MiB): 4 GiB × 1024 = 4096 MiB (multiply by 1024 to move down one unit).<br>Case C (KiB → bits): 1 KiB = 1024 bytes and 1 byte = 8 bits, so 1024 × 8 = 8192 bits.<br>These examples show how to convert between adjacent storage units and between bytes and bits.</div></li>

  <h2>1.3b: Calculate the file size of an image file and a sound file</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">Image file size can be calculated from <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="the number of pixels in the X–Y direction of an image, for example, 4096 × 3192 pixels">resolution</span> and <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="the number of bits used to represent the colours of a pixel">colour depth</span>, and multiplied by the number of images when there are several.</span>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="official-note">Resolution is width × height in <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="derived from the term 'picture element', this is the smallest element used to make up an image on a display">pixels</span>; multiplying width by height gives the total number of pixels.</span></li>

    <li><div class="example-box">Ten small images (step-by-step)<br>Given: 10 images, each 100 × 150 pixels, with 8-bit colour depth.<br>Step 1 (pixels per image): 100 × 150 = 15 000 pixels.<br>Step 2 (bits per image): 15 000 × 8 = 120 000 bits (8 bits per pixel).<br>Step 3 (bits for all images): 120 000 × 10 = 1 200 000 bits (multiply by the number of images).<br>Step 4 (bytes): 1 200 000 ÷ 8 = 150 000 bytes (8 bits = 1 byte).<br>Step 5 (KiB): 150 000 ÷ 1024 ≈ 146.5 KiB (divide by 1024 to convert from bytes to KiB).<br>This sequence explains each calculation and why each conversion is used.</div></li>

        <li><span class="official-note">Sample rate is given in hertz Hz and sample resolution is the number of bits stored for each sample.</span></li>
        <li><span class="official-note">Higher sample resolution stores more detail per sample and increases file size.</span></li>

  <h2>1.3d: Understand lossy and lossless compression methods</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a compression method that reduces the size of a file by permanently removing data">Lossy</span> compression reduces file size by permanently removing data judged unnecessary for typical use.</span>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="official-note">For images, lossy methods can reduce colour depth or resolution to store fewer bits per pixel.</span></li>
        <li><span class="official-note">For sound, lossy methods can remove sounds that are outside normal hearing or softer sounds that occur with louder ones.</span></li>
        <li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a process that is used in lossy compression that removes sounds that are not normally heard by the human ear">Perceptual music shaping</span> removes sounds that are not normally heard by the human ear, so the file becomes smaller while remaining acceptable to listeners.</span></li>
        <li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a lossy file compression method used for music files">MP3</span> is a lossy audio format that uses perceptual music shaping.</span></li>

  </ul>
  <ul class="no-bullets">
    <li><div class="example-box">Text compression using a lookup table<br>Message: WHEN IT IS SNOWING HEAVILY LOOK OUTSIDE. LOOK OUTSIDE IT IS SNOWING HEAVILY.<br>Step 1 (uncompressed size): 62 characters → 62 bytes (1 byte per character).<br>Step 2 (build the table): store repeated words once and record their positions.<br>Step 3 (compressed size): store references to repeated words → 46 bytes.<br>Step 4 (saving): 62 bytes - 46 bytes = 16 bytes saved (about 26 percent).<br>This shows how repeated items reduce storage when references are used instead of storing the same text many times.</div></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">Run-length encoding RLE groups consecutive repeated data and stores the number of repeats together with the data value.</span></li>
    <li><span class="official-note">RLE is effective when long runs of identical items occur.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <ul class="no-bullets">
    <li><div class="example-box">What lossy audio removes<br>A lossy encoder can remove very high-frequency components outside the hearing range and very quiet components masked by louder sounds, so the file becomes much smaller while remaining acceptable to most listeners.<br>This explains the idea behind perceptual removal in audio compression.</div></li>
  </ul>
  <ul class="no-bullets">
    <li><div class="example-box">MP3 size reduction<br>MP3 uses perceptual music shaping and can reduce the size of a normal music file by about 90 percent while keeping quality acceptable for most listening.</div></li>
  </ul>
  <ul class="no-bullets">
    <li><div class="example-box">When to choose lossless<br>Choose lossless when losing any data would be unacceptable, for example a spreadsheet that must be restored exactly.</div></li>
  </ul>
  <ul class="no-bullets">
    <li><span class="fun-tip">Lossy versus lossless is like making a smoothie versus freezing whole fruit: the smoothie removes peels and seeds and you cannot get them back, while freezing keeps everything so you can restore it exactly later.</span></li>
