"question": "State the binary units in order from Byte to TiB and describe how to convert between bits, bytes, KiB and MiB. Explain why 1 MiB equals 1 048 576 bytes.",
"mark_scheme": "Answer 2:\n(State: express in clear terms)\n (Describe: state the points of a topic give characteristics and main features)\n (Explain: set out purposes or reasons make relationships evident provide why andor how)\nUnits in order: Byte, KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB. Each unit equals 1024 of the previous unit.\nConversions: bits to bytes divide by 8; bytes to KiB divide by 1024; KiB to MiB divide by 1024; bytes to MiB divide by 1024 twice.\nReason: 1 MiB equals 1 048 576 bytes because 1 MiB = 1024 KiB and 1 KiB = 1024 bytes, so 1 MiB = 1024 × 1024 = 1 048 576 bytes."

"question": "Explain how to calculate the size of a bitmap image and how colour depth affects the total size.",
"mark_scheme": "Answer 4:\n(Explain: set out purposes or reasons make relationships evident provide why andor how)\nFor an uncompressed bitmap: size in bits = width × height × colour depth. Convert to bytes by dividing by 8, then to KiB or MiB by dividing by 1024 per step. For multiple images, multiply by the number of images. Colour depth is bits per pixel; increasing colour depth increases total size proportionally."

"question": "Justify which compression type is more suitable for emailing photographs when file size must be minimised but typical viewing quality is required.",

MP3 uses this approach."
