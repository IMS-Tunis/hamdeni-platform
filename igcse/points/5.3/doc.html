<h2>5.3a Types of Cyber Security Threats</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">A <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a trial-and-error method used to find passwords or keys by trying every possible combination until the correct one is found">brute-force attack</span> is when a hacker tries to guess a user's password by testing many combinations until the correct one is found.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>This can be done manually or automatically using a program that tries hundreds or thousands of guesses per second.</li>
      <li>Hackers often begin with commonly used passwords like “123456” or “password” before trying random combinations.</li>
      <li>The longer and more complex a password is, the harder it becomes to guess.</li>
      <li>The goal of a <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a trial-and-error method used to find passwords or keys by trying every possible combination until the correct one is found">brute-force attack</span> is to steal personal data or use someone else's account to buy things without permission.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Data interception means capturing data as it travels between devices across a network, often without the user's knowledge.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>A common tool used is a <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="software that monitors data packets being transmitted over a network">packet sniffer</span>, which inspects packets of data sent through routers or Wi-Fi.</li>
      <li>In wired networks, data packets can be intercepted using software installed at a connection point.</li>
      <li>In wireless networks, attackers may use a technique called <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="using a laptop or device to intercept Wi-Fi signals from outside a building, often illegally">wardriving</span>, using a laptop and antenna to collect signals from outside buildings.</li>
      <li>The aim is often to steal confidential information for identity theft or fraud.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">A <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a cyber attack where multiple computers send too many requests to a server to overload and crash it">Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack</span> floods a network, server, or service with an overwhelming amount of fake traffic.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>This makes the system unable to handle real user requests, causing it to slow down or crash.</li>
      <li>A DDoS attack is launched using many computers (a botnet) infected with <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="malicious software designed to harm a computer or steal information">malware</span> to send repeated requests.</li>
      <li>The <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="malicious software designed to harm a computer or steal information">malware</span> allows hackers to control those devices remotely and coordinate the attack.</li>
      <li>It can stop users from checking email, accessing websites, or using online banking.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Hacking is gaining unauthorized access to a system or network, usually with the intent to steal, corrupt, or leak data.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Hackers look for system weaknesses such as unpatched software, open ports, or weak login credentials.</li>
      <li>Once inside, they may delete files, access private data, or cause system failure.</li>
      <li>Even encrypted data can be deleted or modified if <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="gaining unauthorized access to a system or network">hacking</span> is successful.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Malware refers to malicious software designed to harm, steal, or interrupt the normal operation of a system.</span>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Viruses</b> replicate themselves and may delete files or consume storage, making the computer crash.</li>
      <li><b>Worms</b> spread across networks without needing user interaction, often slowing down or damaging systems.</li>
      <li><b>Trojan horses</b> pretend to be legitimate software but contain harmful code that activates when the user installs it.</li>
      <li><b>Spyware</b> secretly monitors user activity and sends information (like keystrokes) to a hacker.</li>
      <li><b>Adware</b> shows unwanted ads and may redirect your browser without permission.</li>
      <li><b>Ransomware</b> encrypts your files and demands payment to unlock them.</li>
      <li><b>Rootkit</b> is <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="malicious software designed to harm a computer or steal information">malware</span> that secretly allows continued access to a system while hiding its presence.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Phishing is a technique where users are tricked into clicking fake links or giving away personal data.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Although phishing is a cyber threat, it is not classified as a type of <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="malicious software designed to harm a computer or steal information">malware</span>.</li>
      <li>The attacker sends an email that looks like it’s from a real bank or service.</li>
      <li>The email urges the user to click a link or update account details on a fake website.</li>
      <li>Signs of <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="fraudulent emails or messages designed to trick recipients into revealing personal information">phishing</span> include generic greetings like "Dear Customer", spelling errors, or mismatched URLs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Pharming redirects the user to a fake website even if they typed the correct URL into their browser.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>This can be caused by malicious code on the user’s computer or tampering with DNS records.</li>
      <li>One common method is DNS cache poisoning, which changes the real IP address to that of the fake site.</li>
      <li>The fake website collects usernames, passwords, or banking details.</li>
      <li>Unlike <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="fraudulent emails or messages designed to trick recipients into revealing personal information">phishing</span>, pharming doesn’t require the user to click a link—it happens automatically.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Social engineering uses deception to trick people into giving away private data or breaking security rules.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>It manipulates emotions like fear, curiosity, or trust.</li>
      <li>Common tactics include scareware, fake phone calls from “support staff,” and baiting with USB drives.</li>
      <li>The attacker often doesn’t need technical skills—only the ability to convince the victim.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul class="no-bullets">
  <li><div class="example-box">A hacker guesses the password 'FILix1234' after discovering the user owns cats named Felix and Max.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">A hacker may use a word list containing one million entries to attempt to break into an account using brute force.</div></li>
  <li><span class="fun-tip">A brute-force attack is like trying to guess the right key for a treasure chest by testing every single key on your keyring — it’s slow, boring, and if your lock is complex, it’ll take forever!</span></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">A hacker uses a laptop and antenna near a building to intercept unencrypted Wi-Fi data.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">Connecting to unprotected public Wi-Fi at an airport can allow a hacker to intercept login credentials and personal messages.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">A DDoS attack using 10,000 bots sends repeated requests to a bank’s website, crashing it for all users.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">A hacker breaks into a hospital database and steals patient medical records by guessing weak passwords.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">A hacker exploits a system vulnerability to copy confidential files and distribute them online.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">Spyware running in the background captures and transmits a user’s credit card details to attackers.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">A fake antivirus program (Trojan) offers a “free scan” but installs spyware and ransomware instead.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">Common phishing messages may say there is a problem with your account or that you have won a prize to make you act quickly.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">A targeted spear phishing email asks for 'urgent account verification' and contains a misspelled URL link.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">An email claims there’s a problem with your Netflix account and links to a fake payment page to steal your card details.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">A user types 'amazon.com' but is redirected to a fake site like 'amaz0n.com' that looks real.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">Pharming websites are designed to look just like real sites so users don’t suspect anything when entering personal information.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">A user enters “paypal.com” but gets sent to a look-alike website that steals their login information.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">A caller pretends to be from IT support and asks for your password to “fix an issue.”</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">A USB drive labeled "Company Salary Report" is left in a public place and installs spyware when plugged in.</div></li>

<h2>5.3b Preventing Cyber Attacks and Threats</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Use a strong password that is long, includes upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid passwords based on birthdays, pet names, or common words.</li>
      <li>Strong passwords are harder for brute-force attacks to guess.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Limit the number of times a user can enter the wrong password before being locked out.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>This makes brute-force attacks less likely to succeed by limiting guessing attempts.</li>
      <li>Another helpful method is <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a challenge-response test used to determine whether a user is human or a bot">CAPTCHA</span>, which stops automated programs from submitting login attempts.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Use <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="verifying the identity of a user or device">authentication</span> methods to verify user identity securely.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Authentication may use something the user knows (e.g. password), has (e.g. mobile phone), or is (e.g. fingerprint).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Use <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a security method that requires two different forms of authentication">two-step verification</span> for added security.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>After entering a password, a code is sent to a trusted device.</li>
      <li>This protects against <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="gaining unauthorized access to a system or network">hacking</span> and brute-force attacks by requiring two separate pieces of information.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Use <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="authentication using physical traits like fingerprints or retina scans">biometric methods</span> like fingerprint or retina scans for secure, user-specific access.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>These are difficult to fake and always unique to the person.</li>
      <li>They add an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Assign different <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="permissions assigned to users that define what data or functions they can access">access levels</span> to users in a system based on what data they need.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>This ensures that only authorized people can view or modify sensitive information.</li>
      <li>Helps limit damage in case of social engineering or <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="gaining unauthorized access to a system or network">hacking</span>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Apply <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="controls that limit how much information is shared or who can view it">privacy settings</span> in social media and browsers.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>This prevents unknown users from seeing your information or tracking your activity.</li>
      <li>Useful in blocking <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="manipulating people into giving up confidential information or breaking security">social engineering</span> attempts.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Install and regularly update anti-<span class="keyword" data-tooltip="malicious software designed to harm a computer or steal information">malware</span> software.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>This detects, quarantines, and removes threats like viruses, worms, <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="software that gathers information about a person or organization without their knowledge">spyware</span>, and ransomware.</li>
      <li>Anti-<span class="keyword" data-tooltip="software that gathers information about a person or organization without their knowledge">spyware</span> software can block programs that try to steal information or hijack your webcam.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Keep software up to date by enabling automatic updates.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Updates fix security holes that hackers might exploit.</li>
      <li>Delaying updates increases the risk of <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="malicious software designed to harm a computer or steal information">malware</span> infections.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Use a <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="software or hardware that blocks unauthorized access to or from a network">firewall</span> to filter incoming and outgoing traffic.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Firewalls can help block various <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="malicious software designed to harm a computer or steal information">malware</span> such as viruses, worms, trojan horses, spyware, ransomware, and adware.</li>
      <li>Firewalls block unwanted data, warn about suspicious access attempts, and enforce security rules.</li>
      <li>They are essential for defending against malware, phishing, pharming, and <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="gaining unauthorized access to a system or network">hacking</span>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Use a <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a server that acts as an intermediary between a user's device and the internet">proxy server</span> as an extra layer between user and internet.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Proxy servers filter web traffic, cache pages, hide user IP addresses, and help prevent DDoS attacks.</li>
      <li>They stop malicious traffic before it reaches a real server.</li>
      <li>Proxy servers can also hide your IP address, cache frequently visited content, and block harmful IP addresses.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to encrypt data transmitted online.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Encryption scrambles data so that only the intended recipient can understand it.</li>
      <li>Websites with “HTTPS” and a padlock symbol use SSL.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Always check emails carefully before clicking links or entering data.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Look for spelling errors, urgent language, or generic greetings (e.g., “Dear customer”). These are signs of <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="fraudulent emails or messages designed to trick recipients into revealing personal information">phishing</span>.</li>
      <li>Hover over links to verify the true destination.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Never click on suspicious pop-ups or fake software warnings.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>These might lead to phishing or download <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="malicious software designed to harm a computer or steal information">malware</span> disguised as antivirus tools.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Be cautious about where you download software from.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Only use trusted sources to avoid hidden <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="malicious software designed to harm a computer or steal information">malware</span> or trojan horses.</li>
      <li>Helps protect against <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="fraudulent emails or messages designed to trick recipients into revealing personal information">phishing</span>, pharming, and social engineering.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="official-note">Create regular backups of your important data on a separate device or cloud service.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>If your computer is attacked by <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="malware that locks or encrypts a user’s data and demands payment to unlock it">ransomware</span>, you can restore files without paying a ransom.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul class="no-bullets">
  <li><div class="example-box">Weak: "Felix123". Strong: "Sy12@#TT90kj=0", which is difficult to guess or crack.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">A user logs into a shopping site, receives a PIN via text, and enters it to complete the login process.</div></li>
  <li><span class="fun-tip">Two-step verification is like needing both a key and a secret handshake to open your front door — even if someone steals your key, they’re still stuck outside!</span></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">Fingerprint scanners have around 1 in 5,000 accuracy, while retina scans are accurate up to 1 in 10 million.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">A mobile phone only unlocks when the correct fingerprint is scanned.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">A junior employee in a company cannot access sensitive financial records due to limited access permissions.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">Setting social media profiles to 'friends only' ensures that only approved people can view your posts.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">A weekly anti-malware scan removes spyware that was secretly logging the user’s keyboard inputs.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">A firewall may block an app from sending keystrokes to an external server.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">During a DDoS attack, the proxy server filters out botnet traffic before it reaches the website.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">A green padlock in the browser indicates that SSL is active, such as during an online banking transaction.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">SSL is used when banking online to protect account numbers and passwords.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">A phishing email shows a link as 'netflix.com' but hovering reveals it actually points to 'billing.com'.</div></li>
  <li><div class="example-box">A pop-up claims your computer is infected and urges you to download a fake “fix.”</div></li>
