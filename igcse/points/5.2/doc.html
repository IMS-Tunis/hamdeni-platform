  <h2>5.2a — Understand the concept of a digital currency and how digital currencies are used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">Most digital currencies rely on a <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A financial system where a central bank controls the processing of payments and transactions">Central banking system</span>.</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">It works like regular money but is exchanged electronically between computers over the internet.</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">Digital currency can be transferred between accounts when making transactions, just like cash or credit cards.</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">It is often used through websites and smartphone apps such as PayPal or Apple Pay.</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">Although digital currency exists only on computer systems, it can still be converted into physical cash if needed.</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">Common methods for using digital currency include credit card payments, mobile phone payments, and smart watch payments. The most frequent method used online is credit card payment.</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">A major issue with centralised systems is maintaining confidentiality and security of online payments.</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="The protection of personal or sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized users">Confidentiality</span> is one of the major risks in centralised digital currency systems, along with data security.</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">When you make a payment using digital currency, the data is <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="Converted into a secure code so it can't be read by others">Encrypted</span>, making the transaction safe.</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">The encryption used in these payments is handled by the <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A secure version of the HTTP protocol used to protect information on websites">HTTPS protocol</span>.</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">Your payment details can also be saved in a <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A small file stored on your device that remembers your details for future visits">Persistent cookie</span>, so you don’t have to enter them again.</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">A <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A special type of digital currency that uses encryption and works without central control">Cryptocurrency</span> was designed to solve the problems of centralised systems by using a decentralised approach.</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">Unlike normal digital currencies, <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="Payments made using cryptocurrencies">Cryptocurrency transactions</span> are not managed by central banks or governments.</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">Instead, the rules and operations of the cryptocurrency are controlled by a community of users, not a central authority.</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">All cryptocurrency transactions are made public, which allows tracking of payments and monitoring of the total money in circulation.</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">Cryptocurrencies are often considered more secure against tampering because they use a system called blockchain to manage transactions without relying on a central bank.</span>
  <ul class="no-bullets">
    <li><span class="fun-tip">Think of digital currency like invisible money in a video game — you can’t hold it, but it buys things, and it zips across the internet faster than a superhero!</span></li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul class="no-bullets">
    <li><div class="example-box">When you shop online using credit cards, mobile payment apps like Apple Pay, or PayPal, you are using digital currency that is stored as data in an online account and transferred electronically. This means money moves from one account to another without any physical cash exchanging hands.</div></li>
  </ul>
  <ul class="no-bullets">
    <li><div class="example-box">If your payment details are stored in a persistent cookie, they will be filled in automatically the next time you shop on the same website, so you don't have to type them again.</div></li>

  <h2>5.2b — Understand the process of blockchain and how it is used to track digital currency transactions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">A <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A decentralised database where each transaction is stored with a timestamp and linked to the previous one">Blockchain</span> ensures that each new transaction is securely connected and traceable.</span>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">All members of the blockchain network store the same copy of the transaction records, making it very difficult for anyone to secretly change the data.</span></li>
      <li><span class="official-note">Any changes to a blockchain record must be approved by a consensus of users on the network, which increases security and reduces the risk of hacking.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">Blockchain technology is used not only for cryptocurrency but also in other fields like smart contracts, pharmaceuticals, education, and politics.</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">A blockchain is made up of many <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="Units that contain data about a transaction, a unique code (called a hash), and a link to the previous block">Blocks</span>.</span>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">Each block contains a <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A unique fingerprint created by an algorithm like SHA-256">Hash value</span> to identify the data and detect any tampering.</span></li>
      <li><span class="official-note">Each new block also records a <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="The exact time and date the block was created">Timestamp</span>, helping prove when the transaction occurred.</span></li>
      <li><span class="official-note">The first block in the chain is called the <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="The very first block in a blockchain, which does not link to any previous block">Genesis block</span>.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">If someone tries to change the data in a block, it alters the hash and breaks the link to the next block, making the entire chain invalid from that point onward.</span>
  <ul class="no-bullets">
    <li><span class="fun-tip">Changing one block in a blockchain is like switching a Lego piece in the middle of a tall tower — the whole thing gets wobbly and might collapse!</span></li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">To prevent fast tampering or fake blocks, a system called <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A method that requires a fixed amount of time and effort before a new block can be added">Proof-of-work</span> is used. For example, in Bitcoin, it takes around 10 minutes for a computer to solve the required problem and generate a new block.</span>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">Special users called <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="Network participants who verify transactions and add new blocks in exchange for a reward">Miners</span> are responsible for checking and validating new blocks before they are added to the blockchain.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">When a new block is created, it is sent to all the computers in the network. These computers verify that the data is correct before the block is added.</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">New users joining the blockchain network receive a full copy of all the existing blocks to stay updated and consistent with the rest of the network.</span>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="official-note">A typical <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="electronic money system">Digital currency</span> transaction using blockchain includes the following steps:</span>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">A digital ledger is used to record the transaction.</span></li>
      <li><span class="official-note">A device encrypts the transaction data.</span></li>
      <li><span class="official-note">The encrypted data is sent to the digital ledger.</span></li>
      <li><span class="official-note">Transactions are stored in blocks, and a single block may contain multiple transactions.</span></li>
      <li><span class="official-note">When a block is full or the transaction set is complete, it is added to the blockchain and shared across all devices in the network.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul class="no-bullets">
    <li><div class="example-box">Because everyone has a copy of the blockchain and all records are encrypted and linked, if someone tries to change a payment record, the change would be obvious to everyone, preventing fraud.</div></li>
  </ul>
  <ul class="no-bullets">
    <li><div class="example-box">In a blockchain:
Block 1 (genesis block) has no previous hash.
Block 2 has its own hash (e.g., "6AB1") and points back to Block 1.
Block 3 has its own hash (e.g., "34EE") and points back to Block 2 ("6AB1").</div></li>
  </ul>
  <ul class="no-bullets">
    <li><div class="example-box">If someone changes Block 2's data, its hash will change (e.g., from "6AB1" to "XXXX"). Block 3 still points to the old hash, making the chain break and invalidating the entire chain from that point forward.</div></li>
