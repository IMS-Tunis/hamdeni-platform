    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">Data sent over long distances is divided into data <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a small unit of data.">packet</span>, sometimes called datagrams, where datagrams is another word for packets; smaller units are easier to control than one continuous stream.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">Using packets allows different routes to be used if one route is busy or unavailable, and the packets are reassembled at the destination into the original message.</span></li>

    <h2>2.1b: Structure of a packet</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">A typical data packet has three parts: a <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a section of a packet of data that contains information about the contents of the packet and its destination.">packet header</span>, the <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="the actual data being carried in a data packet.">payload</span>, and a <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a section of a packet of data that contains information about any error checking methods that may be used.">trailer</span>.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">The packet header includes source and destination <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="the unique address that is given to a device when it is connected to a network.">IP addresses</span>, protocol identification, and sequencing information. It also carries a hop limit that is decreased by each router; if it reaches zero before delivery, the packet is discarded.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">The payload is the actual data carried by the packet; its size is not fixed and depends on the network technology and protocol in use.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">The trailer marks the end of the packet and includes an error-checking method such as a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) in which the sender stores a value derived from the payload bits, the receiver recomputes this value, and any mismatch causes a re-send.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
      <li><span class="fun-tip">A packet is like a posted letter. The header is the address label, the payload is the letter inside, and the trailer is the seal that lets the receiver check nothing went wrong on the journey.</span></li>

    <h2>2.1c: Process of packet switching</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a method of transmitting data packets across a network. Each data packet is able to take an individual pathway across the network.">packet switching</span> splits a message into packets that are sent independently across the network and then reassembled in the correct order at the destination using header information.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">At each stage, routers, which are devices that read the packet header and forward the packet to the next node, choose the next route based on current conditions such as queue lengths, selecting a shortest available path that may differ from the absolute shortest path if parts are busy or unsuitable.</span></li>
          <li><span class="official-note">Packets can arrive out of order, and the destination system reorders them correctly.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">If a packet is missing or corrupted, the destination requests that packet again so the full message can be rebuilt correctly.</span></li>
      <li><span class="official-note">Benefits include avoiding the need to tie up a single line, the ability to reroute around failures or congestion, usage can expand easily, and high data rates; drawbacks include possible packet loss requiring re-sending, delays from reordering, and challenges for real-time streaming.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
      <li><div class="example-box">Different paths in practice: one packet may go through Router A while another goes through Router B, so they arrive in a different order and are then put back into the correct order at the destination.</div></li>
      <li><div class="example-box">Video call delays: during a live video call, sound and video are sent as packets. If parts of the network are busy, some packets take alternate routes or need re-sending, so they arrive late and cause short pauses or out-of-sync audio and video.</div></li>
      <li><span class="fun-tip">Routers behave like map apps that send cars along less busy streets. Different cars from the same group can take different roads, and the parking attendant at the end puts them back in the right order.</span></li>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a transmission method where data is sent one bit at a time down a single wire.">Serial transmission</span> sends data one bit at a time over a single wire or channel.</span>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="official-note">Serial works well over long distances and keeps received data synchronised because there is only one channel, although the data rate is lower than <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a transmission method where data is sent multiple bits at a time down multiple wires.">parallel transmission</span>.</span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">Parallel transmission sends several bits at the same time over multiple wires or channels, often sending a whole byte, where a byte is a group of bits treated as a single unit.</span>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a transmission method where data is transmitted in a single direction only.">simplex</span> transmission sends data in one direction only from sender to receiver.</span>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note"><span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a transmission method where data is transmitted in both directions, but only one direction at a time.">half-duplex</span> transmission allows data to be sent in both directions, but not at the same time.</span>

Bit flow is like getting through a doorway: serial is one person at a time through one door, parallel is several doors side by side that work well only when the corridor is short.</span></li>

      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">Parallel transmission is preferred for short distances and time-sensitive transfers because it can be faster, but it needs more hardware and is therefore more expensive.</span>

    <h2>2.1f: Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="official-note">Universal Serial Bus (<span class="keyword" data-tooltip="an industry standard that is used to transmit data.">USB</span>) uses serial data transfer, and some <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="a collective name for using a USB cable plugged into a USB port to transfer data from one device to another.">USB connection</span> operate in half-duplex or full-duplex modes, meaning they send in both directions either not at the same time or at the same time.</span>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">Selected benefits of Universal Serial Bus (USB) are automatic device detection and setup, keyed connectors that fit only one way, support for different data rates from about 1.5 megabits per second (Mbps) to about 5 gigabits per second (Gbps), and provision of a +5 volt power supply through the cable.</span>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">Selected drawbacks of Universal Serial Bus (USB) are a standard cable length of about 5 metres unless hubs are used, possible lack of support for very early versions on new computers, and data transfer that can be slower than Ethernet on comparable systems.</span>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">For error handling, the Universal Serial Bus (USB) protocol requests re-sending when errors are detected so that the final received data is error-free.</span>
      </li>
      <li><span class="official-note">USB-C is a form of Universal Serial Bus (USB) with a 24-pin symmetrical connector that can be inserted either way and supports up to about 100 watts at 20 volts for power delivery, data rates up to about 10 Gbps, and high-resolution video such as 4K, while remaining backward compatible when a suitable adaptor is used.</span>

      <li><div class="example-box">USB memory stick transfer: copying files between a USB flash drive and a computer uses Universal Serial Bus (USB) serial transfer, which shows how devices are detected automatically and data moves through a simple one-way-fit connector.</div></li>
      <li><span class="fun-tip">USB-C is like a reversible key that fits either way. A USB cable can also carry a little power, so one wire can both move data and keep small devices powered.</span></li>
