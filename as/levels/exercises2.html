{
"question": "MCQ: Identify a selection statement",
"question_self_contained": "Choose the option (A to D) that contains a selection statement (an IF or CASE decision).\n\nOptions:\nA) CALL Sort(Value1, Value2)\nB) DECLARE Count : INTEGER\nC) IF X = 7\n   THEN\n     Y \u2190 21\n   ENDIF\nD) Total \u2190 X + Y",
"mark_scheme_answer": "C",
"explanation": "A selection statement chooses between paths using a condition. Option C is an IF\u2013THEN\u2013ENDIF decision. Option A is a procedure call, option B is a declaration, and option D is a simple assignment. Only C performs a conditional choice."
},
{
"question": "IF with numeric threshold (fever check)",
"question_self_contained": "Write pseudocode that reads a real-valued temperature and prints whether the person has a fever (strictly greater than 37) or not.\n\nInput: a REAL temperature\nOutput: a message stating fever or normal",
"mark_scheme_answer": "DECLARE temperature : REAL\nINPUT temperature\n\nIF temperature > 37 THEN\n    OUTPUT \"You have a fever.\"\nELSE\n    OUTPUT \"Your temperature is normal.\"\nENDIF",
"explanation": "The value is compared to 37. If the condition temperature > 37 is true, the program outputs the fever message; otherwise it outputs the normal message. ENDIF marks the end of the decision. Using a strict greater-than keeps 37.0 as normal."
},
{
"question": "IF\u2013ELSE equality decision",
"question_self_contained": "Read two integers A and B. If A equals B, print \"Equal\"; otherwise print \"Not equal\".\n\nInputs: A, B as INTEGER\nOutput: a single word indicating equality",
"mark_scheme_answer": "INPUT A\nINPUT B\n\nIF A = B THEN\n    OUTPUT \"Equal\"\nELSE\n    OUTPUT \"Not equal\"\nENDIF",
"explanation": "The operator = tests equality. Exactly one branch prints: \"Equal\" when A and B match, or \"Not equal\" when they differ. The branches are mutually exclusive."
},
{
"question": "IF with CHAR input (Yes/No)",
"question_self_contained": "Read a single character Resp that is exactly 'Y' or 'N' (uppercase). If Resp is 'Y', print \"Yes\"; otherwise print \"No\".\n\nInput: Resp as CHAR\nOutput: \"Yes\" or \"No\"",
"mark_scheme_answer": "INPUT Resp\n\nIF Resp = 'Y' THEN\n    OUTPUT \"Yes\"\nELSE\n    OUTPUT \"No\"\nENDIF",
"explanation": "Compare a CHAR using single quotes. Only 'Y' yields \"Yes\". Any other character (including 'N') yields \"No\". The ELSE gives complete coverage without a second comparison."
},
{
"question": "Single-branch IF (absolute value)",
"question_self_contained": "Read a real number V. If V is negative, replace it by its absolute value. Print the final value of V.\n\nInput: V as REAL\nOutput: V (non-negative after the change)",
"mark_scheme_answer": "INPUT V\n\nIF V < 0 THEN\n    V \u2190 -V\nENDIF\n\nOUTPUT V",
"explanation": "A single-branch IF changes only negative numbers. When V < 0, negating makes it positive. Non-negative values pass through unchanged. Finally, V is printed."
},
{
"question": "Parity test with MOD",
"question_self_contained": "Read a non-negative integer N. Print \"Even\" if N is divisible by 2, otherwise print \"Odd\".\n\nInput: N as INTEGER with N \u2265 0\nOutput: \"Even\" or \"Odd\"",
"mark_scheme_answer": "INPUT N\n\nIF N MOD 2 = 0 THEN\n    OUTPUT \"Even\"\nELSE\n    OUTPUT \"Odd\"\nENDIF",
"explanation": "The expression N MOD 2 gives the remainder on division by 2. A remainder of 0 indicates an even number; any other remainder indicates an odd number."
},
{
"question": "Guard before division (zero check)",
"question_self_contained": "Read two integers X and Y. If Y is zero, print \"Division by zero\". Otherwise, print the real division result X / Y.\n\nInputs: X, Y as INTEGER\nOutput: a warning or the result of division",
"mark_scheme_answer": "INPUT X\nINPUT Y\n\nIF Y = 0 THEN\n    OUTPUT \"Division by zero\"\nELSE\n    OUTPUT X / Y\nENDIF",
"explanation": "Division by zero is undefined. The guard IF Y = 0 handles this case first. Only when Y is nonzero do we compute and output X / Y."
},
{
"question": "Range validation with OR",
"question_self_contained": "Read an integer Age. If Age is less than 0 or greater than 120, print \"Invalid\"; otherwise print \"Valid\".\n\nInput: Age as INTEGER\nOutput: \"Invalid\" or \"Valid\"",
"mark_scheme_answer": "INPUT Age\n\nIF (Age < 0) OR (Age > 120) THEN\n    OUTPUT \"Invalid\"\nELSE\n    OUTPUT \"Valid\"\nENDIF",
"explanation": "The OR operator detects either out-of-range case: negative or beyond 120. If neither condition is true, the age is within [0, 120] and is printed as valid."
},
{
"question": "NOT with a Boolean flag (payment status)",
"question_self_contained": "Read a Boolean HasPaid (TRUE or FALSE). If the customer has not paid, print \"Payment required\"; otherwise print \"Access granted\".\n\nInput: HasPaid as BOOLEAN\nOutput: a message about access",
"mark_scheme_answer": "INPUT HasPaid\n\nIF NOT HasPaid THEN\n    OUTPUT \"Payment required\"\nELSE\n    OUTPUT \"Access granted\"\nENDIF",
"explanation": "Using NOT inverts the Boolean value. When HasPaid is FALSE, NOT HasPaid becomes TRUE and the program prints \"Payment required\". When HasPaid is TRUE, the ELSE branch prints \"Access granted\"."
},
{
"question": "Conjunction (AND) for eligibility",
"question_self_contained": "Ask the user for age and whether they are a student (TRUE or FALSE). Print \"Eligible\" only when age < 25 and the person is a student; otherwise print \"Not eligible\".\n\nInputs: age as INTEGER, isStudent as BOOLEAN\nOutput: \"Eligible\" or \"Not eligible\"",

"explanation": "AND requires both parts to be true. The age condition (younger than 25) and the student status must both hold. If either part is false, the ELSE branch is chosen."
},
{
"question": "AND requirement for two exams",
"question_self_contained": "Read two exam scores Exam1 and Exam2 (0 to 100). Print \"Qualified\" only if both scores are at least 50; otherwise print \"Not qualified\".\n\nInputs: Exam1, Exam2 as INTEGER\nOutput: \"Qualified\" or \"Not qualified\"",

"explanation": "Both comparisons must be true at the same time for a qualification. If either score is below 50, the combined AND condition fails and the ELSE branch prints \"Not qualified\"."
},
{
"question": "Mixed AND/OR (senior benefits)",
"question_self_contained": "Read gender as 'M' or 'F' and an integer age. Print \"Eligible for senior benefits\" if (gender = 'M' and age > 65) or (gender = 'F' and age > 60). Otherwise print \"Not eligible\".\n\nInputs: gender as CHAR ('M' or 'F'), age as INTEGER\nOutput: an eligibility message",
"mark_scheme_answer": "DECLARE gender : CHAR\nDECLARE age : INTEGER\n\nINPUT gender\nINPUT age\n\nIF (gender = 'M' AND age > 65) OR (gender = 'F' AND age > 60) THEN\n    OUTPUT \"Eligible for senior benefits.\"\nELSE\n    OUTPUT \"Not eligible.\"\nENDIF",
"explanation": "This decision has two valid cases joined by OR. The first case applies to males over 65, the second to females over 60. Parentheses make the grouping unambiguous."
},
{
"question": "Precedence with parentheses (age and consent)",
"question_self_contained": "Read an integer Age and a CHAR Consent that is 'Y' or 'N'. Print \"Eligible\" when (Age \u2265 16 and Consent = 'Y') or when Age \u2265 18. Otherwise print \"Not eligible\".\n\nInputs: Age as INTEGER, Consent as CHAR\nOutput: \"Eligible\" or \"Not eligible\"",

"explanation": "Parentheses force the AND part to be evaluated together before the OR. Eligibility is granted either by being at least 18, or by being at least 16 with explicit consent 'Y'."
},
{
"question": "Nested IF for sign classification",
"question_self_contained": "Read an integer number. Print whether it is positive, negative, or zero.\n\nInput: number as INTEGER\nOutput: one of the three strings: \"The number is positive.\", \"The number is negative.\", or \"The number is zero.\"",
"mark_scheme_answer": "DECLARE number : INTEGER\nINPUT number\n\nIF number > 0 THEN\n    OUTPUT \"The number is positive.\"\nELSE\n    IF number < 0 THEN\n        OUTPUT \"The number is negative.\"\n    ELSE\n        OUTPUT \"The number is zero.\"\n    ENDIF\nENDIF",
"explanation": "The first IF separates positive from non-positive. Inside the ELSE, a second IF distinguishes negative from zero. At most one output is produced."
},
{
"question": "Multiple outcomes with divisibility",
"question_self_contained": "Read an integer number. Print one of four messages: divisible by both 3 and 5, divisible by 3 only, divisible by 5 only, or not divisible by 3 or 5.\n\nInput: number as INTEGER\nOutput: one message describing divisibility",
"mark_scheme_answer": "DECLARE number : INTEGER\nINPUT number\n\nIF (number MOD 3 = 0) AND (number MOD 5 = 0) THEN\n    OUTPUT \"The number is divisible by both 3 and 5.\"\nELSE\n    IF number MOD 3 = 0 THEN\n        OUTPUT \"The number is divisible by 3 only.\"\n    ELSE\n        IF number MOD 5 = 0 THEN\n            OUTPUT \"The number is divisible by 5 only.\"\n        ELSE\n            OUTPUT \"The number is not divisible by 3 or 5.\"\n        ENDIF\n    ENDIF\nENDIF",
"explanation": "Test the strongest condition first: both divisibilities at once using AND. If that fails, test divisibility by 3, then by 5. If none match, report the final case. MOD gives the remainder; a remainder of 0 means divisible."
},
{
"question": "Sequential IFs to get the maximum of three",
"question_self_contained": "Read three integers A, B, C. Print the largest value among them.\n\nInputs: A, B, C as INTEGER\nOutput: the maximum value",
"mark_scheme_answer": "INPUT A\nINPUT B\nINPUT C\n\nMax \u2190 A\n\nIF B > Max THEN\n    Max \u2190 B\nENDIF\n\nIF C > Max THEN\n    Max \u2190 C\nENDIF\n\nOUTPUT Max",
"explanation": "Start by assuming A is the largest. If B is larger than the current Max, update Max to B. Then, if C is larger than the current Max, update Max to C. Finally, print Max. This works even when values are equal."
},
{
"question": "Independent IFs (child fare and peak surcharge)",
"question_self_contained": "Read integer Age and CHAR Peak ('Y' or 'N'). The base fare is 4. If Age < 12, set Fare to 2 (child fare). Independently, if Peak = 'Y', add 1 to Fare. Print the final Fare.\n\nInputs: Age as INTEGER, Peak as CHAR\nOutput: Fare as a number",
"mark_scheme_answer": "INPUT Age\nINPUT Peak\n\nFare \u2190 4\n\nIF Age < 12 THEN\n    Fare \u2190 2\nENDIF\n\nIF Peak = 'Y' THEN\n    Fare \u2190 Fare + 1\nENDIF\n\nOUTPUT Fare",
"explanation": "The two rules are independent, so we use two separate IF statements. The first sets a discounted child fare; the second adds a peak surcharge. Both can apply, one can apply, or neither can apply."
},
{
"question": "Nested IF (child ticket gate)",
"question_self_contained": "Read integer Age and CHAR HasTicket ('Y' or 'N'). If Age < 12, admit only when HasTicket = 'Y'; otherwise print \"Ticket required\". If Age \u2265 12, print \"Use adult gate\".\n\nInputs: Age as INTEGER, HasTicket as CHAR\nOutput: one gate instruction",

"explanation": "The outer IF checks whether the person is a child. Only in the child case do we check ticket possession with an inner IF. For ages 12 or more, we skip the inner test and go straight to the adult gate."
},
{
"question": "Round then decide (pass threshold)",
"question_self_contained": "Read a percentage P (0 to 100). Let Q be P rounded to the nearest integer (x.5 rounds up). If Q \u2265 50, print \"Pass\"; otherwise print \"Fail\".\n\nInput: P as REAL\nOutput: \"Pass\" or \"Fail\"",
"mark_scheme_answer": "INPUT P\nQ \u2190 ROUND(P)\n\nIF Q \u2265 50 THEN\n    OUTPUT \"Pass\"\nELSE\n    OUTPUT \"Fail\"\nENDIF",
"explanation": "Rounding is applied before the threshold test. Values such as 49.5 become 50 and therefore pass. The IF compares the rounded integer Q to the cutoff 50."
},
{
"question": "ELSEIF ladder for grade bands",
"question_self_contained": "Read an integer Score (0 to 100). Print a single letter grade using these thresholds: A for Score \u2265 80; B for \u2265 70; C for \u2265 60; D for \u2265 50; otherwise E.\n\nInput: Score as INTEGER\nOutput: one letter A, B, C, D, or E",

{
"question": "CASE with numeric ranges (exam score)",
"question_self_contained": "Read an integer exam score. Print the letter grade using: 90 to 100 \u2192 A; 80 to 89 \u2192 B; 70 to 79 \u2192 C; 60 to 69 \u2192 D; otherwise F.\n\nInput: score as INTEGER\nOutput: \"Grade: A\" or \"Grade: B\" or ...",

"question": "CASE with computed total (shipping zone)",
"question_self_contained": "Read an integer Zone (only 1, 2, or 3 are valid). The base cost is 5. Output 5 for Zone 1, 8 for Zone 2, and 12 for Zone 3. For any other value, print \"Invalid\".\n\nInput: Zone as INTEGER\nOutput: a cost or \"Invalid\"",
